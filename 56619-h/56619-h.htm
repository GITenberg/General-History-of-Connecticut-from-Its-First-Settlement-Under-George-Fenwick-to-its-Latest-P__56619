<h3 class="h3head">PREFACE.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Though</span> Connecticut be the most flourishing, and,
proportionally, the most populous, province in North
America, it has hitherto found no writer to introduce
it, in its own right, to the notice of the world. Slight
and cursory mention in the accounts of other provinces,
or of America in general, has yet only been made of
it. The historians of New England have constantly
endeavored to aggrandize Massachusetts Bay as the parent
of the other colonies, and as comprehending all that
is worthy of attention in that country. Thus Governor
Hutchinson says, in the preface of his history of that
province, that “there was no importation of planters
from England to any part of the continent northward
of Maryland, excepting to Massachusetts, for more
than fifty years after the colony began;” not knowing,
or willing to forget, or to conceal, that Saybrook, New
Haven, and Long Island, were settled with emigrants
from England within half that period. Another reason
<!--004.png--><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
for the obscurity in which the Connectitensians have
hitherto been involved is to be found among their own
sinister views and purposes: Prudence dictated that
their deficiency in point of right to the soil they occupied,
their wanton and barbarous persecutions, illegal
practices, daring usurpations, etc., had better be concealed
than exposed to public view.</p>

<p>To dissipate this cloud of prejudice and knavery,
and to bring to light truths long concealed, is the motive
of my offering the following sheets to the world.
I am bold to assert that Connecticut merits a fuller account
than envy or ignorance has yet suffered to be
given it; and that I have followed the line of truth
freely, and unbiased by partiality or prejudice. The
reader, therefore, will not be surprised should I have
placed the New-Englanders in a different light from
that in which they have yet appeared: their characterizers
have not been sufficiently unprejudiced, unawed
by power, or unaffected by the desire of obtaining it,
always to set them in a true one. Dr. Mather and Mr.
Neal were popular writers, but, at the time they extolled
the prudence and piety of the colonists, they
suppressed what are called in New England unnecessary
truths. Governor Hutchinson, who loved fame,
and feared giving offense, published a few only of those
truths, which failed not to procure him a proportionate
share of popular distrust and odium. For my own
<!--005.png--><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
part, I believe my readers will give me credit for having
neither the favor nor the fear of man before me in
writing this history of Connecticut. I discard the one;
I court not the other. My sole aim has been to represent
the country, the people, and their transactions, in
proper colors. Too much, however, must not be expected
from me. I am very sensible of many great defects
in this performance, wherein very little assistance
was to be obtained from publications of others. Mr.
Chambers, indeed, who is writing “Political Annals of
the Present United Colonies,” pursues that task with
great pains and address. His researches have been of
some use to me; but, as to the New England writers,
error, disguise, and misrepresentations, too much abound
in them to be serviceable in this undertaking, though
they related more to the subject than they do. The
good-natured critic, therefore, will excuse the want of a
regular and connected detail of facts and events which
it was impossible for me to preserve, having been deprived
of papers of my ancestors which would have
given my relation that and other advantages. I hope,
therefore, for much indulgence, striking, as I have
done, into a new and dark path, almost without a
guide. If I have carried myself through it, though
with some digressions, yet without incurring the danger
of being accounted a deceiver, my disordered garb will,
I presume, find an apology in the ruggedness of the
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
road—my Scriptural phraseology be ascribed to the
usage of my country.</p>

<p>For three generations my forefathers were careful
observers of the proceedings of the Connecticut colonists;
and if their papers and myself should continue
in existence till a return of peace shall restore them to
my possession, I trust the public will not be displeased
with the design I have of committing them to the
press. In the mean time, lest that event should never
take place, I beg their acceptance of the present volume,
which, whatever other historical requisite it may
want, must, I think, be allowed to possess originality
and truth (rare properties in modern publications), and,
therefore, I hope, will not be deemed unworthy the
public favor.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">SECOND PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Mr. James Hammond Trumbull</span>, the author of the
work entitled “The Blue Laws of Connecticut and
New Haven, and the False Blue Laws invented by the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters,” which has just made its appearance,
attempts to throw discredit on the work of Dr.
Peters, and represents it as a fiction, and a calumny
upon the early settlers of Connecticut.</p>

<p>Mr. Trumbull seems to have spared no trouble in
his researches to show that no such laws as the “Blue
Laws” represented by Dr. Peters were in existence,
and to impress this more forcibly upon the public he
gives the laws of 1639, 1650, and 1656; when, had he
looked more carefully at the doctor’s “History of Connecticut,”
he would have found he alluded to them in
these words: “The laws made by the independent Dominion,
and nominated the Blue Laws by the neighboring
colonies, were never suffered to be printed;”
nevertheless, Mr. Trumbull shows that there were laws
<!--008.png--><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
at that time equally repugnant, though clothed in more
subtile phraseology, but pointing to the same result,
and that these laws were rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters’s “History of Connecticut” was published
in London, in 1781, and possibly there are not
twenty persons living who have ever read it. As its
truthfulness was unpalatable to the Connecticut colony,
the issue that came to this country, I believe, was publicly
burnt, and the court prohibited the republishing
of the work in the State; consequently it has become a
very rare work, so much so that in March, 1877, a copy,
at a sale of old works, brought the fabulous price of
one hundred and fifteen dollars, demonstrating the fact
that but few remained in existence.</p>

<p>The appearance, therefore, of Mr. Trumbull’s work
gives the public but one side of the case; under these
circumstances I have been induced to republish the
work from the original copy belonging to Dr. Peters,
using notes and quotations from writers and authors of
high repute, and from documents and manuscripts written
before the Revolutionary War, which have come
into my possession since Mr. Trumbull’s work has appeared,
and which, I believe, will show the unbiased
public that Mr. Trumbull has not been guided solely
by unselfishness in attempting to wipe out the ridicule
entailed on Connecticut by the early Blue Laws; but
he still retains a little of the fanaticism, bigotry, and
<!--009.png--><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
spleen, so justly attributed to his ancestor, who was the
cause of driving Dr. Peters from his native country;
and he would now attempt to cast discredit upon a
work that was well received in the State by the intelligent
portion of the community, and indorsed as a true
history.</p>

<p>In writing of the “Blue Laws,” Prof. De Vere, of
the University of Virginia, in his volume on “Americanisms,”
published in 1872, says, “They are confirmed
without a doubt.” The late <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> A. B. Chapin,
in his article published in the <cite>Churchman</cite> of Hartford,
Connecticut, August 19, 1876, entitled “Was
the History of Connecticut a Fabrication?” says, “If
Dr. Peters had had my advantages he might have been
a worse historian for Connecticut than he has been already.”
I might continue such quotations from persons
of equally high standing, but my object is to let
the work stand upon its merits, giving it to the public as
it left the author’s hands, merely adding such portions
as I find in the unpublished manuscripts in my possession,
relating chiefly to the doctor himself, and the
cause of his having to leave the country; also to the
action taken by the colony of Connecticut for the
relief of the destroyers of the teas in Boston.</p>

<p>It has not been for the purpose of obtaining a character
for the work, which it did not before possess, that
I again bring it before the public; but that they may
<!--010.png--><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
have both sides of the case for their view, joined with
that of defending my ancestor, the author, a good and
venerable old clergyman, who was driven from his
country, and his large estates sequestrated, for obeying
“the laws of his God, the laws of his country, and
the dictates of his conscience, by the fanatics of Connecticut,”
and from the unjust and unwarrantable attacks
of Mr. Trumbull.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">After</span> several unsuccessful attempts to form settlements
in the southern part of North America, in which
little more had been done than giving the name of Virginia,
in compliment to the virgin Queen Elizabeth, to
the country, a patent was obtained in 1606, from James
I., by Sir Thomas Gates and associates, for all lands
there between the thirty-fourth and forty-fifth degrees
of north latitude; and, at the patentees’ own solicitation,
they were divided into two companies;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
to the former
of which were granted all the lands between the thirty-fourth
and forty-first degrees of north latitude, and to the
latter all those between the thirty-eighth and forty-fifth
degrees. A part of the coast of the territory last mentioned
being explored in 1614, and a chart presented to
the then Prince of Wales, afterward Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, it received
from him the appellation of New England.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, notwithstanding the
claim of the English in general to North America, and
the particular grant to Sir Thomas Gates and associates,
above mentioned, the Dutch got footing on Manhattan
or New York Island, pushed up Hudson’s River,
as high as Albany, and were beginning to spread on its
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
banks when, in 1614, they were compelled by Sir Samuel
Argal to acknowledge themselves subjects of the
King of England, and submit to the authority of the
Governor of Virginia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
</p>

<p>For the better enabling them to accomplish their
American undertakings, the Plymouth Company, in
1620, obtained a new patent, admitting new members of
rank and fortune. By this they were styled “The Council,
established at Plymouth, for planting and governing
the said country called New England;” and to them
were now granted all the lands between the fortieth and
forty-eighth degrees of north latitude, and extending
east and west from the Atlantic ocean to the South Sea,
except such as were then actually possessed by any
Christian prince or people.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--013.png--><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
Not long afterward, the patentees came to the resolution
of making a division of the country among themselves
by lot, which they did in the presence of James
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> The map of New England, etc., published by Purchas
in 1625, which is now become scarce, and probably
the only memorial extant of the result, has the following
names on the following portions of the coast:</p>

the division above mentioned extended to that or not.
Probably, it was not then sufficiently explored. However,
in 1635, the patentees, from the exigency of their
affairs, thinking a surrender of their patent to the king,
with reservation of their several rights with regard to
the property of the land, an advisable measure, a new
division of the coast was struck out, consisting of twelve
lots, extending to and comprising lands on the west side
of Hudson’s River, and, of course, the Dutch settlement
at Manhattan. The following is an account of these
lots:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ensp;1. From the river <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix to Pemaquid.</li>

<li>&ensp;2. From Pemaquid to Sagadahoc.</li>

<li>&ensp;3. The land between the rivers Amarascoggin and Kenebec.</li>

<li>&ensp;4. From Sagadahoc along the sea-coast to Piscataqua.</li>

<li>&ensp;5. From Piscataqua to Naumkeak (or Salem).</li>

<li>&ensp;6. From Naumkeak, round the sea-coast by Cape Cod to Narraganset.</li>

<li>&ensp;7. From Narraganset to the half-way bound, between that and
Connecticut River, and so fifty miles up into the country.</li>

<li>&ensp;8. From the half-way bound to Connecticut River, and so fifty
miles into the country.</li>

<li>&ensp;9. From Connecticut River along the sea-coast of Hudson’s River,
and so up thirty miles.</li>

<li>10. From the thirty miles’ end to cross, up forty miles eastward.</li>

<li>11. From the west side of Hudson’s River thirty miles up the country
toward the fortieth degree, where New England beginneth.</li>

<li>12. From the end of the thirty miles up the said river, northward
thirty miles further, and from thence to cross into the land
forty miles.—(“Hutchinson’s History of Massachusetts
Bay.”)</li>
</ul>

<p><!--015.png--><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
These divisions were immediately, on the above-mentioned
surrender, to be confirmed by the king to the
proprietors, and proposed to be erected into so many
distinct provinces, under one general Governor of New
England. It is certain that this plan was not then carried
into execution in the whole. Several, if not all of
the lots were formally conveyed to their respective
owners previous to the resignation of the patent. How
many were confirmed by the king is not known; there
is positive evidence of but one—to Sir Ferdinando
Gorges.</p>

<p>The eighth and ninth lots nearly form the province
of Connecticut, taking its name from the great Indian
king who reigned when the English made their first inroads
into the country.</p>

<p>But before I give an account of this event, it may
be proper to premise a few particulars concerning the
Dutch, already spoken of as having seated themselves
on New York Island and the banks of Hudson’s River,
and also concerning the settlements formed by the English
in and near the Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>The same year which established the Council of
Plymouth, established also the Dutch West India Company,
to whom the States of Holland are said to have
granted, the year after, all the lands between Capes
Cod and Henlopen.</p>

<p>Under their encouragement and support the Dutch
at New York were induced to look upon the act of
Argal with contempt; accordingly, they revolted from
the allegiance he had imposed upon them, cast off the
authority of their English Governor, and proceeded in
their colonizing pursuits under one of their own nation;
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
in which they seemed to have employed their wonted
industry, having, before the year 1637, erected a fort
on the spot where Hartford now stands.</p>

<p>A party of Brownists, who in 1619 are said to have
obtained a grant of land from the Virginia Company,
set sail on the 6th of September in the following year
for Hudson’s River; but making on the 11th of November
the harbor of Cape Cod instead of the place of
their destination, and finding themselves not in a fit
condition to put to sea again at such a late season of
the year, they ranged along the coast till a commodious
situation presented itself, when they disembarked, and
founded the colony of New Plymouth.</p>

<p>Seven years afterward a party of Puritans procured
a grant of the lands from Merrimack River to the southernmost
part of Massachusetts Bay. They made their
first settlement at Naumkeak, by them now named
Salem, and a second at Charlestown. Great numbers
of the Puritans followed their brethren to New England,
so that, within a few years, was laid the foundation
of Boston and other towns upon the Massachusetts
coast.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Thus far had colonization taken place in the neighboring
country when, in 1634, the first part of the English
adventurers arrived in Connecticut from England<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>

<!--017.png--><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
under the conduct of George Fenwick, Esq., and the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Peters, and established themselves at the
mouth of the Connecticut River, where they built a
town, and which they called Saybrook, a church, and a
fort.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--018.png--><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
In 1636 another party proceeded from Boston under
the conduct of Mr. John Haynes and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas
Hooker, and in June settled on the west bank of the
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
Connecticut River, where Hartford now stands, notwithstanding
the Dutch had found their way thither
before them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--020.png--><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
A third party of English settlers in Connecticut
were headed by Mr. Theophilus Eaton and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
John Davenport, who left England early in the year
1637, and, contrary to the advice of the people of Massachusetts
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
Bay, who were very desirous of their settling
in that province, fixing themselves in the July following
on the north side of a small bay wherein the river
Quinnipiack empties itself, forty miles southwest of
Hartford, and there built the town of New Haven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--022.png--><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
Thus, within the space of three years, was Connecticut
seized upon by three distinct English parties, in
three different places, forming a triangle; by what authority
I will now beg leave to inquire.</p>

<p><!--023.png--><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
In favor of the first, it is alleged that they purchased
part of the lands belonging to the Lords Say and Brook,
which land included the eighth and ninth lots, and had
been assigned to them by the Earl of Warwick, who,
about the year 1630, obtained a grant of the same from
the Council of Plymouth, and a patent from the king,
and that Fenwick was properly commissioned to settle
and govern the colony.</p>

<p>Neal, Douglas, and Hutchinson, speak of the grant
and assignment with the greatest confidence, but make
no reference where either may be consulted.</p>

<p>They were very willing to believe what they said,
and wished to palm it upon the credulity of their readers
as a fact too well established to need proof. I shall
endeavor to show the futility of their assertions; indeed,
Mr. Hutchinson himself inadvertently gives reason
to doubt the truth of them, writing of the transactions
of 1622: “The Earl of Warwick,” says he, “we are assured,
had a patent for the Massachusetts Bay about the
same time, but the bounds are not known.” It will appear
presently that a part of the territory in question
was, in 1635, granted to the Marquis of Hamilton. Now,
taking these several items together, the Council of Plymouth
are represented to have granted not only to Massachusetts
Bay in 1622, but also, in 1630, a region of vast
extent, including Connecticut, to the Earl of Warwick;
and then, in 1635, they have regranted the best part of
the latter to the Marquis of Hamilton. There is an infeasibility
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
in this supposition that, without proof, will
deprive it of all credit among persons who have no particular
interest in the support of it.</p>

<p>True it is that Fenwick and his associates were properly
authorized to settle upon lands belonging to Lords
Say and Brook; but that the lands they did settle upon
were the property of the Earl of Warwick is not only
without proof, but against it.</p>

<p>It seems to be generally agreed that the Lords Say
and Brook were understood to have a right to lands
upon Connecticut River, but that river being five hundred
miles long, and running through the greatest part
of New England, the situation of their property was by
no means pointed out; whether it lay at the mouth,
the middle, or the northern end, was equally unascertained.</p>

<p>The settlers, indeed, established themselves at the
mouth, but without showing their right to the spot;
they licentiously chose it. There never has been produced
any writing of conveyance of the land in question
from the Council of Plymouth to the Earl of Warwick,
or from the Earl of Warwick to the Lords Say
and Brook, and therefore their title to it must be deemed
not good in law. By a letter from Lord Say to Mr.
Vane, in 1635, it appears that he (Lord Say), Lord
Brook, and others, had thought of removing to New
England, but were not determined whether to join the
adventurers in Boston or settle a new colony.—(Hutchinson’s
“History,” <abbr title="volume one, page">vol. i., p.</abbr> 42.)</p>

<p>If Connecticut had been assigned to Lords Say and
Brook by the Earl of Warwick, as it is pretended was
done in 1631, it is very strange that those lords should
<!--025.png--><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
have been in doubt in 1635 where to fix themselves in
New England, since interest and ambition, as well as
fertility of soil, would naturally have led them to settle
in Connecticut, where they had land of their own,
and where a settlement was already begun, and bore a
very promising appearance. Hence, it seems but reasonable
to suppose that if Lords Say and Brook were entitled
to any land on Connecticut River it could not lie
within the province of Connecticut; and, if their claims
were derived from the Earl of Warwick, it may fairly
be concluded that their property lay much higher up
the country, since the coast appropriated to the Earl of
Warwick by Purchas is that at or about Cape Ann.
Lords Say and Brook, therefore, might have a right to
send Fenwick, Peters, etc., to colonize on the north
parts of Connecticut River, but not southwardly, at the
mouth of it; and their neglect of the colony at Saybrook
may easily be accounted for, by supposing that
they were sensible the settlers had fixed upon a wrong
site—an idea corroborated by this circumstance, that
Fenwick some years after sold his property there for a
mere trifle, when he might have sold it dear if his title
had been good.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, who were the real proprietors
of the eighth and ninth lots?</p>

<p>It is asserted that, on the Council of Plymouth’s resignation
of their patent to Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> in 1635, that monarch
granted the latter to the Earl of Stirling.</p>

<p>Possibly there is not now existing any written testimony
of this grant, yet it seems authenticated by the
sale which the earl made in 1639, by his agent, Forrest,
of the eastern part of Long Island, as appertaining to
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
his lot, to Mr. Howell. However, though his claim is
not, perhaps, clearly to be established, it is by no means
liable to the many objections urged against that of Lords
Say and Brook, which will in a manner be annihilated
by the additional argument I am now going to adduce
from the positive proof there is to whom the eighth lot
really belongs.</p>

<p>It stands authenticated in the office of the Lords
Commissioners of Colonies that, in April, 1635, was
conveyed to James, Marquis of Hamilton, by a deed
from the Council of Plymouth, the territory lying between
Narraganset Bay and Connecticut River.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
The
right to the eighth lot, therefore, was clearly vested in
the marquis; and it only remains to be shown why
his descendants are not in possession of it to remove
every doubt upon the matter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the civil broils of his time the
marquis engaged and died fighting under the royal
banners, while the king’s enemies took possession of
his lands in Connecticut. At the restoration of Charles
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> to his crown, reason taught the children of royal
sufferers to expect a restoration at least of their landed
<!--027.png--><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
property; and the daughter of the Marquis of Hamilton
petitioned Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> to grant her relief with respect
to the land lying between Narraganset Bay and
the Connecticut River—a relief she had the more reason
to hope for, as “her father had died fighting for
his father.” But Charles had been too much polished
in foreign courts to do anything effectual for his suffering
friends. Afterward the Earl of Arran applied to
William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> for redress in regard to the same land;
but that earl having acted on the wrong side at the
revolution, could not but expect as little from William
as the friends of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> had received from him.
However, William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> ordered the Lords Commissioners
of the colonies to state his title, which they fairly
did; and the earl was referred to try his case in Connecticut,
before the very people who had his lands in
possession.</p>

<p>The Governor and Company of Connecticut gave
a formal answer to the claims of the Earl of Arran,
setting up a title under the Earl of Warwick, as is
above mentioned, who, they said, disposed of the land
in dispute to Lord Say and Seal and Lord Brook, and
the Lords Say and Brook sold the same to Fenwick,
Peters, and others. The Earl of Arran answered that,
“when they produced a grant from the Plymouth
Company, of those lands to the Earl of Warwick, it
should have an answer;” but the colony was silent,
and King William was silent also.—(<span class="latin">Vide</span> “Records of
New England,” A., <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 170-201.)</p>

<p>Since, then, no proof of any title derived from the
Earl of Warwick could be produced by the Governor
and Company of Connecticut, when the question of
<!--028.png--><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
right to the country was fairly brought into litigation,
and since there is a record of the grant of the eastern
part of it to the Marquis of Hamilton, it is evident
that the claim of the present possessors under Lords
Say and Brook is not valid. The record of the Marquis
of Hamilton grant is an irrefragable proof that
those lords had no right to the tract between Narraganset
Bay and Connecticut River; and thence the
conclusion is fair that they had no right to the tract
between Connecticut and Hudson’s River; for their
title to both having but one and the same foundation,
it follows, of course, that what destroys it in the former
destroys it in the latter also.</p>

<p>However disputable the Earl of Stirling’s claim to
the land between Hudson and Connecticut Rivers may
be, the Duke of Hamilton is undoubtedly the rightful
owner of that between the latter and Narraganset Bay.
This much I have proved, to show the errors of Mather,
Neal, Douglas, and Hutchinson, who assert what the
above record contradicts. I differ in opinion also with
divines who say that the world grows every day worse
than it was the last. I believe the world is growing
better every year; and that justice will be administered
to the Duke of Hamilton, and other noble proprietors
of lands in New England, who have been wickedly
supplanted by the emigration of Puritans, republicans,
regicides, and smugglers. The time, I hope, is hastening,
when the records I have quoted will be considered,
and unjust possessors be ordered to give up their possessions
to the right owners; for we have a king who
honors his crown, and prefers justice to policy.</p>

<p>Hooker and Haynes, who conducted the second of
<!--029.png--><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
the three English parties already spoken of as making
inroads into Connecticut, and who fixed their headquarters
at Hertford, left Massachusets Bay for the
same reason they had before left England—to avoid
being persecuted, and to acquire the power to persecute.
Hooker was learned, ambitious, and rigid. He
lived near Boston two years, in hopes of becoming a
greater favorite with the people than the celebrated
Mr. Cotton; but, finding himself rather unlikely to
meet with the desired success, he devised the project
of flying into the wilderness of Connecticut, to get a
name. Accordingly, in 1635 he applied to the General
Court for leave to remove thither, but was refused.
The next year, however, for reasons which will hereafter
appear, he found the fanatics more compliant;
and he and Haynes obtained permission to emigrate
into Connecticut, carrying with them, as Mr. Neal expresses
it, “a sort of commission from the government
of Massachusets Bay for the administration of justice”
there.</p>

<p>But it cannot be supposed that Hooker and his
associates could derive any title to the soil, from this
permission and commission granted by the Massachusets
colony, who had not the least right to it themselves.
The emigrants not only did not entertain any
such idea, but, as soon as they had discovered a situation
that pleased them, they even set at naught the
commission which they took with them, the professed
object of which was to secure the authority and jurisdiction
claimed by the Massachusets colony over them.
Knowing that they had passed the limits of that province,
they voted themselves an independent people,
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
and commenced despots, pleading the old adage, <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salus
populi suprema lex</span>. It has never been suggested, I
believe, that this party entered Connecticut with any
other semblance of authority than this ridiculous permission
and commission of the Massachusets dictators.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--031.png--><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
As to the third party, headed by Eaton and Davenport,
they took possession, as is already mentioned,
without even pretending any purchase, grant, permission,
or commission, from any one. Of these three
parties, then, it appears that the last two had not the
least shadow of original right to the lands they possessed
themselves in Connecticut; and the claims of
the first I have shown to be ill-founded. I will now
consider the right they are pretended to have acquired
after possession; in regard to which they seem to have
been put upon the same footing, by a general war between
them and the Indians, occasioned by the ambitious,
oppressive, and unjust conduct of Hooker and
Davenport. This war opened a door to king-killing
and king-making, violence, and injustice, in America,
similar to what we have of late years shuddered to
hear of in India. Hence the colonies have endeavored
to establish a title to the lands by purchase of the
natives. Accordingly, they have produced deeds of
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
sale signed by Sunksquaw, Uncas, Joshua, Moodus,
and others, whom Mr. Neal and Dr. Mather call sachems,
and consequently owners of the soil. Whether
those gentlemen knew, or did not know, that Connecticut
was owned by these sachems only, who, with
their wives and families, were killed by the English,
and who never would give a deed of any land to the
Dutch or English, is not material; since it is a fact
that not one of those Indians who have signed those
famous deeds was ever a sachem or a proprietor of a
single foot of land claimed by the colony.</p>

<p>It is true that Uncas (whom Mr. Neal calls a sachem,
because the colonists declared him King of Mohegan,
to reward him for deserting Sassacus, sachem
of the Pequods) gave deeds of the land that he had no
right or title to; and so did Sunksquaw, who, after
murdering his sachem Quinnipiog, was also declared
sachem by the English Dominion<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
of Newhaven.
Gratitude, or pride, induced all those English-made
sachems to assign deeds to their creators.</p>

<p>After the death of Uncas, his eldest son, Oneko,
became King of Mohegan, who refused to grant any
deeds of land to the colony; whereupon, vexed at his
wisdom and honor, they declared him an incestuous
son, deposed him, and proclaimed his natural brother,
Abimeleck, to be sachem of the Mohegans. Oneko
gave a deed of all his lands to Mason and Harrison,
who were his friends; as did Abimeleck, of the same
lands, to the colony who had made him sachem. This
laid a foundation for a suit at law, which was first
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
tried before the judges of the colony, where Mason, of
course, lost his suit. He appealed to the King in Council,
who ordered a special court to sit at Norwich, in
Connecticut: Mr. Dudley, a learned man, and Governor
of Massachusetts Bay, was president of it. The
court met, and, having heard the evidence and pleadings
of both parties, gave a verdict in favor of Mason’s
claim. The colony appealed home to England, but
never prosecuted their suit to an issue. Mason died.
The colony kept possession under Abimeleck, their
created King of Mohegan. About ten years ago the
heirs of Mason and Harrison petitioned the government
to decree that Dudley’s verdict should be enforced;
but the colonists found means to confound the
claims of those competitors without establishing their
own. The truth is, neither the colonists nor Mason
and Harrison ever had any deed or title to those lands
from Sassacus or his heirs; their deeds spring from
Uncas, already mentioned, a rebel subject of Sassacus,
without any royal blood in his veins. Nevertheless,
Mr. Neal, and others, who have written histories of
New England, have taken especial care to vindicate the
justice of the settlers, who always, they say, conscientiously
purchased their lands of the sachems. I have
given the reader some idea of the purchases of the first
colonizers in Connecticut, who by their iniquitous act
of making Sachems have entailed lawsuits without end
on their posterity; for there is not one foot of land in
the whole province which is not covered by ten deeds
granted by ten different nominal sachems to ten different
persons; and, what aggravates the misfortune, the
courts of justice differ every session concerning the
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
true sachem, so that what a plaintiff recovers at a hearing
before one jury, he loses upon a rehearing before
another.</p>

<p>Enough, surely, has been said to nullify the colonists’
plea for having bought their lands from the Indians.</p>

<p>As to any purchases made of the Saybrook settlers,
those of Hertford totally declined them till the farcical
business respecting their charter came into agitation between
the two juntos who procured it, of which I shall
speak hereafter; and, so far were the people of Newhaven
from buying any right of Fenwick or his associates
that they scorned the idea of claiming under
them; nay, it was one of their principal views, in the
machinations wherein they were continually employed,
to reduce the Saybrook colony under the tyranny of
their own dominions as having no more title to the
country than possession gave them. And, upon the
other supposition, it is impossible to account for the
neglect of the colonizers of Hertford to secure their
lands by such a purchase, seeming as they did to ransack
heaven and earth for a title satisfactory even in
their own eyes; they were conscious no purchase of
that kind could give them firmer footing than they had
already.</p>

<p>The truth, therefore, undoubtedly is that Fenwick
and Peters had no legal right to sell the lands they occupied,
whatever might be their pretensions; nor, indeed,
did they pretend to the power of selling more on
their own account than was granted to them severally
by their patrons—the Lords Say and Brook—which cannot
be supposed but an inconsiderable proportion of
their American property.</p>

<p><!--035.png--><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
No wonder, then, that we find another claim set
up—a claim by conquest. This was particularly agreeable
to the genius of the Hertford and Newhaven
heroes, but will nevertheless appear to as little for their
right as their honor, from the following considerations:
1. The invaders did not find Connecticut in a state of
Nature, but cultivated and settled by its Indian inhabitants,
whose numbers were thousands, and who had
three kings, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, Connecticote, Quinnipiog, and Sassacus,
of whom Connecticote was the emperor, or king of
kings—a dignity he and his ancestors had enjoyed, according
to the Indian mode of reckoning, twenty sticks,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>

i. e., time immemorial; 2. They had no authority
to invade, make war upon, and conquer the Indians,
who were not at war with the King of England, nor
his patentees, or their assignees; and, 3. Seizures, without
legal commission, of however long standing, do not
convey right or title by the English law.</p>

<p>Feeling the weight of these considerations, the colonists
have been obliged to found their claim to the
country on their charter, which was obtained in 1662—more
than twenty-six years after they had taken possession.
Here, again, they are destitute of support, for
the king, any more than his subjects, could not give to
others the property of the Duke of Hamilton unless his
title had been proved to be forfeited by due course of
law. But the charter created no title; it merely conferred
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
on the people the authority of a legal corporation,
without conveying any title to the lands. And,
indeed, the prevarications of the colonists themselves
with regard to the charter-claim sufficiently explode it.
Whenever they find their property affected by any duty,
custom, etc., imposed by Parliament, and warranted by
charter, they allege that they got the lands in possession
by their own arms, without the aid of the King and
Parliament of Great Britain; as Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> allowed in
granting the charter, which conveyed no title, but was
founded upon the title they possessed before the date
of it. At other times, when these selfish temporizers
find it convenient either for promoting their own, or
preventing their neighbors’ encroachments, they then
plead their charter as the one only thing needful to
prove their right of land even to the South Sea itself.</p>

<p>In short, and upon the whole, possession, begun in
usurpation, is the best title the inhabitants of Connecticut
ever had, or can set up, unless they can prove they
hold the lands by a heavenly grant, as the Israelites did
those of Canaan.</p>

<p>This heavenly title was, indeed, set up by Peters,
Hooker, and Davenport, the first three ministers that
settled Connecticut, and is generally believed through
the Colony to this day. They thus syllogistically stated
it: “The heathen are driven out, and we have their
lands in possession; they were numerous, and we but
few; therefore, the Lord hath done this great work, to
give his beloved rest.”</p>

<p>This much for the various pretensions of the occupiers
of Connecticut in regard to their right to the soil.
I shall now give some account of the proceedings of the
<!--037.png--><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
first settlers with respect to their religious and civil establishments,
and of their political transactions, etc.</p>

<p>The party which settled at Saybrook, under George
Fenwick, Esquire, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Peters, in 1634,
contented themselves, in framing the polity of their civil
constitution, with the laws of England and a few local
regulations.</p>

<p>As to their ecclesiastical institutions, they voted
themselves to be a church independent on lords bishops,
and Mr. Peters to be their minister, whose episcopal
ordination was deemed good, notwithstanding he
had been silenced in England. They voted presbyters
to be bishops, and possessed of power to ordain ministers
when invited by a proper number of people formed
into a society by a license from the Governor. They
voted that a certain part of the liturgy of the Church of
England might be used—the Lord’s Prayer, the Apostles’
Creed, together with one chapter in the Bible, to
be read at morning and evening service, or omitted, at
the discretion of the minister; that extempore prayers
might be used at the pleasure of the minister, but that
the surplice should not be worn, nor should the sign of
the cross at baptisms, the ceremony of the ring at marriages,
or saints’-days, etc., be observed, as in the Church
of England; that every society licensed by the Governor,
after having a minister ordained over it, be a
complete church, and invested with the keys of discipline,
dependent only upon Christ, the head of the
church; that the minister should be the judge of the
qualifications of church-membership, and should censure
disorderly walkers; that the members in full communion
should have power over the minister, and might
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
dismiss him from his parish by a majority of voices and
with the consent of the Governor; that all children
were the objects of baptism, and that none should be
debarred that sacrament for the sins of their parents,
provided an orderly liver would engage to bring them
up in the ways of Christianity; that all sober persons
might partake of the Lord’s Supper, provided the minister,
upon examination, should find them sufficiently
acquainted with their duty; that what is commonly
called conversion is not absolutely necessary before receiving
the Lord’s Supper, because that sacrament is a
converting ordinance; that all gospel ministers were
upon an equality in office; and that it was the business
of every one to admonish the transgressor, privately
in the first place, and next, if no attention was paid
to his advice, before his deacons; then, if their admonishment
was disregarded, the offender should be presented
to the church (that is, the minister, deacons, and
communicants, united by the keys of discipline), and,
upon his still continuing refractory, he should be censured
and rejected by the majority of voters without
any appeal; that deacons should be chosen by the minister
and communicants upon a majority of voices, and
ordained by the minister according to the holy practice
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul; that it was the duty of the Governor and
civil magistrates to protect and nurture the Church, but
not to govern it, because Christ’s authority, given to
his Church, was above principalities and all civil powers,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>The settlers of Hertford, having declared themselves
to be an independent Colony, and that their dominions
extended from sea to sea, voted Haynes to be their
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
Governor, and appointed six councilors to assist him
in framing laws and regulating the State. The same
spirit of independence dictated their church discipline.
They voted Mr. Hooker to be their minister, and six of
their church-members to ordain him. Mr. Hooker accepted
of their vote, or call, renounced his Episcopal
ordination, and was ordained by the six lay church-members,
over the church of the Independents in Hertford.
Thus, Mr. Hooker, who was born in Leicestershire,
educated at Cambridge, ordained by a bishop,
silenced by a bishop in 1630, in England, and reordained
by six laymen in America, became what he
wished to be—the head of the Independents in the
Dominion of Hertford, where he had the honor and
pleasure of exercising over all who differed from him
in opinion that violent spirit of persecution which he
and his friends so clamorously decried as too intolerant
to be endured in England. Some of the characteristic
doctrines of this persecuting fanatic were of the following
purport: That Christ’s Church was not universal,
but a particular visible church, formed by general consent
and covenant; that Christ had committed the
power of binding and loosening to believers, without
any distinction between clergy and laity; that ruling
and preaching elders are duly ordained to their office
by the election and the imposition of the hands of the
people; that the tables and seals of the covenant, the
offices and censures of Christ’s Church, the administrations
of all public worship and ordinances, are in the
<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cœtus fidelium</span>, or combination of godly, faithful men
met in one congregation; that a diocesan, provincial,
or national assembly, is incompatible with the nature
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
of Christ’s Church, seeing all and every member of
Christ’s Church are to meet every Lord’s-day, in one
place, for the administration of the holy ordinances of
God; that a multitude of free people may elect and ordain
a king over them, although they were not, prior to
that act, possessed of kingly power; for the people of
Israel imposed their hands on Levites, when they themselves
were not Levites (Numbers <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 10); that Nature
has given virtual power to a free people to set up
any Christian form of government, both in church and
state, which they see best for themselves in the land;
but Christ gave the power of his keys to his Church,
i. e., to his believing people, and not to Peter or to
Paul as ministers, but as professed believers, in conjunction
with the rest of true believers; that the Church
hath not absolute power to choose whom it will; it hath
ministerial power only to choose whom Christ hath
chosen, i. e., such as He hath gifted and fitted for the
work of the ministry; that neither popes, bishops, nor
presbyters, are necessary to ordain ministers of Jesus
Christ, because the power of the keys are given by
Christ to his Church, i. e., the people in covenant with
God; that as ordination is in the power of each church,
no church hath power over another, but all stand in
brotherly equality; that it is unlawful for any Church
of Christ to put out of its hand that power which Christ
hath given it into the hands of other churches; that no
one church ought to send to ministers of other churches
to ordain its ministers or to censure its offenders; that
baptism does not make any one a member of Christ’s
Church, because papists and other heretics are baptized;
therefore, to be a member of Christ’s Church is
<!--041.png--><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
to own the covenant of that particular church where
God has placed such members; that seven persons may
form a Church of Christ, but fifteen thousand cannot,
because such a number cannot meet in one place, nor
hear, nor partake, nor be edified together; that no one
can partake of the Lord’s Supper till he be converted,
and has manifested his faith and repentance before the
church, etc., etc.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
The laws made by the Governor and Council of
Hertford are, in general, much of the same stamp as
those of the Newhaven legislators, of some of which
an abstract will be given hereafter.</p>

<p>The fanatics at Newhaven, in like manner with
those of Hertford, voted themselves to be a Dominion
independent, and chose Eaton for their Governor, and
Davenport for their minister. The Governor and a
committee had the power of making laws for the State,
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
and the minister, assisted by deacons and elders, was to
rule the church. The following is a specimen of the
tenets established by Davenport in the latter:</p>

<p>That Christ has conveyed all power to his people
both in church and state; which power they are to
exercise until Christ shall return on earth to reign one
thousand years over his militant saints—that all other
kings, besides Christ and his elected people, are pestilent
usurpers, and enemies of God and man—that all
vicars, rectors, deans, priests, and bishops, are of the
devil; are wolves, petty popes, and antichristian tyrants;
that pastors and teachers of particular congregations are
of Christ and must be chosen by his people, i. e., the
elect and chosen from the foundation of the world, or
else their entrance and ministry are unlawful; that all
things of human invention in the worship of God, such
as are in the Mass-Book and Common-prayer, are unsavory
in the sight of God; that ecclesiastical censures
ought to be exercised by the members of particular congregations
among themselves; that the people should
not suffer this supreme power to be wrested out of their
hands until Christ shall begin his reign; that all good
people ought to pray always that God would raze the
old papal foundation of the episcopal government, together
with the filthy ceremonies of that antichristian
church; that every particular who neglects this duty,
may justly fear that curse pronounced against Meroz
(Judges <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 23): “Curse ye Meroz, because they came not
to the help of the Lord against the mighty” enemies of
God and his church; that every particular congregation
is an absolute church, the members of it are to be all
saints; those must enter into covenant among themselves,
<!--044.png--><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
and without such covenant there can be no
church; that it is a heinous sin to be present when
prayers are read out of a book by a vicar or bishop;
that subjects promise obedience to obtain help from the
magistrates, and are discharged from their promise when
the magistrates fail in their duty; that, without liberty
from the prince or magistrate, the people may reform
the church and state, and must not wait for the magistrate,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>This Dominion, this tyrant of tyrants, adopted the
Bible for its code of civil laws, till others should be
made more suitable to its circumstances. The provision
was politic. The lawgivers soon discovered that the
precepts in the Old and New Testaments were insufficient
to support them in their arbitrary and bloody undertakings;
they, therefore, gave themselves up to their
own inventions in making others, wherein, in some instances,
they betrayed an extreme degree of wanton
cruelty and oppression, that even the religious fanatics
of Boston, and the mad zealots of Hertford, put to the
blush, christened them the “Blue Laws,” and the former
held a day of thanksgiving, because God, in his good
providence, had stationed Eaton and Davenport so far
from them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--045.png--><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
The religious system established by Peters at Saybrook
was well calculated to please the moderate Puritans
and zealots of all denominations; but the fanatics
of the Massachusets-Bay, who hated every part of the
Common Prayer-book worse than the Council of Trent,
<!--046.png--><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
and the papal power exercised over heretics, were
alarmed at the conduct of the half-reformed schismatics
in that colony; and, thinking that their dear Salem
might be endangered by such impure worshipers, consented,
in the year 1636, to give Mr. Hooker and his
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
associates liberty to emigrate to Hertford, notwithstanding
the preceding year they had refused such liberty,
seeing then no reason for Hooker’s seizing the
territory of other people. But when the New England
vine was supposed to be threatened by the Bible, Lord’s
Prayer, and Ten Commandments, the pious people of
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
Massachusets-Bay permitted Hooker, in 1635, to remove
into and govern Connecticut by their authority,
and to impede and break up the worship of the
Peterites at Saybrook. Hooker, ever faithful to his
trust, excepting that, when he got to Hertford, he rejected
the authority of his employers in the Massachusets-Bay,
set up a new Dominion, and persecuted the
Peterites under his own banner, though he called it
the banner of Jesus. But for his and Davenport’s
tyrannical conduct, the colony of Saybrook would have
lived in peace with the Indians, as they did till their
artful and overbearing neighbors brought on a general
war between them and the English, which ended with
the death of Sassacus and the destruction of all his subjects.
After that war great dissension arose among the
conquerors. Fenwick was sensible, of a calm disposition,
and very religious, yet not entirely void of ambition;
he claimed the government of Connecticut, and
insisted upon payment for such lands as were possessed
by Hooker and Davenport and their associates; this, he
said, was common justice, due to his constituents, the
Lords Say and Brook. Hooker and Davenport, however,
were not fond of his doctrine of justice, but made
religion, liberty, and power, the great object of their
concern, wherein they were supported by the people of
Massachusets-Bay, whose spirits were congenial with
their own; hence no opportunity was lost of prejudicing
Saybrook, and the troubles in the mother-country
furnished their enemies with many. One step they
took, in particular, operated much to their disadvantage.
The Massachusets colony, eager to act against
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, agreed with those of Hertford, Newhaven,
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
Newhampshire, and Rhode-Island, to send agents to
England, assuring the House of Commons of their
readiness to assist against the king and bishops. The
Saybrook settlers, though zealous against the bishops,
were not much inclined to rebellion against the king,
and therefore took no part in this transaction.</p>

<p>As the royal cause lost ground in England, the apprehensions
of this colony increased; and Fenwick,
finding himself unsupported by the Lords Say and
Brook, thought it prudent to dispose of his colonial
property to Peters and his associates, and return to
England.</p>

<p>Confusion being established in England, moderation
became an unpardonable sin in Saybrook, which both
the neighboring colonies were ready to punish by assuming
the jurisdiction there: mutual jealousy alone prevented
it. At length, during Cromwell’s usurpation,
the inhabitants, fearing the effects of his displeasure for
not joining in the above-mentioned address to the Commons
of England, especially lest he should put them
under the power of the furious Davenport, and at the
same time foreseeing no prospect of the restoration,
judged it advisable, by way of preferring the lesser to
the greater evil, to form a sort of alliance and junction
with the people of Hertford, where Hooker now lay
numbered with the dead.</p>

<p>The colony was not only hereby enabled to maintain
its ground, but flourished greatly; and the minister,
Thomas Peters, established a school in Saybrook, which
his children had the satisfaction to see become a college,
denominated Yale College, of which a particular account
will be given in the course of this work. He was a
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
churchman of the Puritanic order, zealous, learned,
and of mild disposition, and frequently wrote to his
brother Hugh at Salem to exercise more moderation,
lest “overmuch zeal should ruin him and the cause they
were embarked in.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--051.png--><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
At his death, which did not happen till after the
Restoration of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, he bequeathed his library to
the school above mentioned.</p>

<p><!--052.png--><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
The religious institutions of Hooker at Hertford
were not only binding on the Dutch, but even extended
to the great Connecticote himself. The Sachem did
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
not like his new neighbours; he refused to give or sell
any land to them; but told them, that, as they came to
trade, and to spread the Christian Religion among his
subjects, which Mr. Hooker defined to consist only in
peace, love, and justice, he had no objection to their
building wigwams, planting corn, and hunting on his
lands. The wisdom and steady temper of this great
Sachem, and the vast number of subjects at his command,
made Haynes and Hooker cautious in their conduct.
Many people of Massachusets-Bay, hearing that
Hooker had made good terms with the Sachem, left
their persecutors, and fled to the fertile banks of Connecticut,
that they might help Hooker spread the Gospel
among the poor benighted Heathen in the wilderness.
The Reverend Mr. Huet, with his disciples, fixed
at Windsor, eight miles north of Hertford; and the
Reverend Mr. Smith, at Weathersfield, four miles south
of it. In the space of eighteen months, the Dominion
of Hertford contained seven-hundred white people, and
seven independent churches. Having converted over
to the Christian faith some few Indians, among whom
was Joshua, an ambitious captain under the great Sachem
Connecticote, Hooker, Huet, Smith, and others,
hereby found means to spread the <em>Gospel</em> into every
<!--054.png--><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
Indian town, and, to the eternal infamy of christian
policy, those renowned, pious fathers of this new colony,
with the Gospel, spread the small-pox. This distemper
raged in every corner: it swept away the great
Sachem Connecticote, and laid waste his ancient kingdom.
Hereupon, Haynes and his assembly proclaimed
Joshua Sachem; and such as did not acknowledge his
sachemic power, were compelled to suffer death, or fly
the Dominion. Thus in three years time, by the Gospel
and fanatic policy, was destroyed Connecticote, the
greatest king in North-America. This remarkable
event was considered as the work of the Lord; and the
savage nations were told that the like calamities would
befal them, unless they embraced the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Joshua was grateful to the English who had
made him Sachem, and gave them deeds of those lands
which had constantly been refused by Connecticote.
But Joshua had as little honour as virtue and loyalty:
he supported himself many years by signing deeds, and
gulled the English through their own imprudence in
neglecting to make a law for recording them.—These
colonists, having driven out the Heathen, and got possession
of a land which flowed with milk and honey,
expelled the Dutch, as a dangerous set of heretics;—and
Hooker, after doing so much for this new Dominion,
expected the homage from every Church which is only
due to a Bishop. This homage, however, he could not
obtain, because each Minister had pretensions not much
inferior to his. Disputes arose about Doctrine and
Discipline. Hooker taught that there were forty-two
kinds of Grace, though all of little value, except that
of ‘saving Grace.’ As to Discipline, he held, that, as
<!--055.png--><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
he had received his ministerial ordination from the
Laity, who were members in full communion, he considered
those actual communicants as <em>Christ’s Church
here on earth</em>, and consequently as holding the keys of
discipline; and he maintained that the Minister had
but a single voice, and was a subject of the Church.
Other Ministers, who had received episcopal ordination,
but had been silenced by their Bishops, judged themselves,
notwithstanding, to be Ministers of Christ; and
alleged that the installation of a Minister by prayer
and imposition of hands of lay communicants, was no
ordination, but a ceremony only of putting a Minister
in possession of his Church, from which he might be
dismissed by a majority of voters of the Members in
full communion. And those Ministers taught for doctrine,
that mankind were saved by Grace, and that the
Gospel told us of but one Grace as necessary to Salvation;
for that <em>he who believes that Jesus is the Son of
God, is born of God, and enjoys the Grace of God
which brings Salvation</em>. The majority of the People
of course were on the side of Mr. Hooker, as his plan
established their power over the Minister; and they
soon determined by vote, according to their code of
laws, in his favour. But the Ministers and minority
were not convinced by this vote, and, to avoid an excommunication,
formed themselves into separate bodies;
nevertheless, they soon felt the thundering anathemas
of Hooker, and the heated vengeance of the civil power.
However, persecution, by her certain consequence, fixed
the separatists in their schism, which continues to the
present time.—Hooker reigned twelve years high-priest
over Hertford; and then died above sixty years of age,
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
to the great joy of the separatists, but, in point of
populousness, to the disadvantage of the colony of
Saybrook, which was the little Zoar for Hooker’s
heretics.</p>

<p>Exact in tything mint and anise, the furies of
Newhaven for once affected the <em>weightier matters</em> of
justice. They had no title to the land: they applied
to Quinnipiog, the Sachem, for a deed or grant of it.
The Sachem refused to give the lands of his ancestors
to strangers. The settlers had teeming inventions, and
immediately voted themselves to be the <em>Children of
God</em>, and that <em>the wilderness in the utmost parts of the
earth</em> was given to them. This vote became a law forever
after. It is true, Davenport endeavoured to <em>christianize</em>
Quinnipiog, but in vain: however, he <em>converted</em>
Sunksquaw, one of his subjects, by presents and great
promises; and then Sunksquaw betrayed his master,
and the settlers killed him. This assassination of Quinnipiog
brought on a war between the English and Indians,
which never ended by treaty of peace. The
Indians, having only bows and arrows, were driven
back into the woods; whilst the English, with their
swords and guns, kept possession of the country. But,
conscious of their want of title to it, they voted Sunksquaw
to be Sachem, and that whoever disputed his
authority should suffer death. Sunksquaw, in return,
assigned to the English those lands of which they had
made him Sachem. Lo! here is all the title the settlers
of the Dominion of Newhaven ever obtained.—The
cruel and bloody persecutions under Eaton and Davenport
in Newhaven soon gave rise to several little towns
upon the sea-coast. Emigrants from England arrived
<!--057.png--><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
every year to settle in this Dominion; but few remained
in Newhaven, on account of Eaton, Davenport,
the Deacons, and Elders, who possessed all power there,
and were determined to keep it. The new-comers,
therefore, under pretence of spreading Christ’s kingdom,
and shunning persecution, joined with the settlers at
Stamford, Guilford, and Stratford, where, however,
persecution domineered with as much fury as at Newhaven;
for each town judged itself to be an independent
Dominion; though, for fear of the Dutch and the
Indians, they formed a political union, and swore to
bear true allegiance to the capital Newhaven, whose
authority was supreme. As all officers in every town
were annually elected by the freemen, and as there
were many candidates, some of whom must be unsuccessful,
there was always room for complaints. The
complainants formed schisms in the Church, which
brought on persecution; and persecution drove the
minority to settle new towns, in order to enjoy Liberty,
Peace, and Power to persecute such as differed from
them. Thus lived those ambitious people, under far
worse persecutions from one another than they ever
experienced or complained of in Old-England; all
which they endured with some degree of patience, the
persecuted one year living in hopes that the next would
enable them to retaliate on their persecutors.</p>

<p>The laws made by this independent Dominion,
and denominated <em>Blue-Laws</em> by the neighbouring Colonies,
were never suffered to be printed; but the following
sketch of some of them will give a tolerable idea
of the spirit which pervades the whole.</p>

<p>Of such sort were the laws made by the people of
Newhaven, previous to their incorporation with Saybrook
and Hertford colonies by the charter. They
consist of a vast multitude, and were very properly
termed <em>Blue Laws</em>; i. e. <em>bloody Laws</em>; for they were
all sanctified with excommunication, confiscation, fines,
banishment, whippings, cutting off the ears, burning
the tongue, and death. Europe at this day might well
say the Religion of the first settlers at Newhaven was
fanaticism turned mad; and did not similar laws still
prevail over New-England as the common law of the
country, I would have left them in silence along with
Dr. Mather’s <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patres conscripti</span>, and the renowned
Saints of Mr. Neal, to sleep to the end of time. No
one, but a partial and blind bigot, can pretend to say
the projectors of them were men of <em>Grace</em>, <em>Justice</em>,
and <em>Liberty</em>, when nothing but <em>murders</em>, <em>plunders</em>, and
<em>persecutions</em>, mark their steps. The best apology that
can be made for them is, (I write in reference to those
times,) that human nature is every-where the same;
and that the mitred Lord and canting Puritan are both
equally dangerous, or that both agree in the unchristian
doctrine of persecution, and contend only which shall
put it in practice. Mr. Neal says many call the first
Colonizers in New-England weak men for separating
from the Church of England, and suffering persecutions,
rather than comply with indifferent ceremonies;
and, after asserting that they were men of great learning
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
and goodness, he appeals to the world to judge,
which were weak, the Bishops or the Puritans? My
answer is, that those Puritans were weak men in Old
England, and strong in New England, where they out-pop’d
the Pope, out-king’d the King, and out-bishop’d
the Bishops. Their murders and persecutions prove
their strength lay in weakness, and their religion in
ambition, wealth, and dominion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the perpetual jealousy and discordance
between the three colonies of Connecticut,
(Saybrook claiming the whole under the Lords Say and
Brook, Hertford under Jehovah and Conquest, and
Newhaven under King Jesus and Conquest,) they
judged it necessary, for their better security against
the Dutch and Indians, to strengthen each other’s
hands by forming a general confederacy with the Colonies
of New Plymouth and the Massachusets-Bay. A
measure of this kind, which they formally entered into
in 1643, proved of the most salutary consequence, in a
war which many years after broke out between them
and Philip, sachem of the Pokanoket Indians, and
which, for some time, imminently endangered the Colonies,
but at length terminated in the destruction of that
noted warrior and his followers.</p>

<p>The death of Cromwell in 1658 struck an awe
throughout all New-England. Hertford and Newhaven
appointed their days of fasting and prayer. Davenport
prayed “the Lord to take the New-England Vine
under his immediate care, as he had removed by death
the great Protector of the protestant liberty:” nevertheless
he lived to see the time when Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> obtained
the possession of his Father’s crown and kingdom,
<!--063.png--><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
in spite of all his prayers. However, in the midst
of sorrows, they were comforted by the presence of
many regicides and refugees, who fled from England
not so much for religion as for liberty; among whom
were Whalley, Goffe, and Dixwell,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
three of the judges
and murderers of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Davenport and Leet the
then Governor received them as Angels from Heaven,
and blessed God that they had escaped out of the hands
of “Herod the son of Barabbas.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--064.png--><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
Newhaven Dominion being thus suddenly filled
with inhabitants, saw itself enabled to support its independence,
and as usual despised Hertford and Saybrook,
and withal paid no attention to the King and
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>
Parliament of England.—The People of Massachusets,
who were ever forward in promoting their own consequence,
observing the temper and conduct of those of
Newhaven, conceived an idea at once of exalting an individual
<!--066.png--><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
of their own province, and of attaching Hertford
and Saybrook to their interest for ever. They
sent Mr. John Winthrop privately to Hertford, to promote
a petition to Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> for a charter, as a security
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
against the ambition of Newhaven.—The Bostonians
boasted of having had the honour of settling Hertford,
which they therefore professed to consider in the
light of a near and dear connection. The proposal was
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
accepted by the few persons to whom it was communicated,
but, in framing their petition, they found themselves
deficient in their title to the lands. This obliged
them to have recourse to a Junto at Saybrook, who
claimed a title under Lords Say and Brook.—A few
purchases, or rather exchanges, of land now took place
between the Junto’s; after which a petition was drawn
up, containing an artful description of the lands claimed,
“part of which they said they had purchased, and part
they had conquered.” They then as privately appointed
Mr. Winthrop their agent to negociate the business in
England, which he very willingly undertook. On his arrival
here, he applied to the agents of Massachusets-Bay,
and with their assistance procured from the incaution
of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> as ample a charter as was ever given to a
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>
palatinate state; it covered not only Saybrook, Hertford,
and Newhaven, but half New-York, New-Jersey, and
Pensylvania, and a tract of land near 100 miles wide,
and extending westward to the South sea, 1400 miles
from Narraganset bay. This charter, which was obtained
in 1662, well pleased the people of Hertford,
because it coincided with their former vote, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “that
their dominion extended from sea to sea.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
Newhaven
Dominion too late discovered the intrigues of her artful
neighbours; and, after two years opposition, submitted
to the charter purely out of fear lest some of her ministers
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>
and magistrates should suffer ignominious deaths
for aiding in the murder of their King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
</p>

<p>To the great joy of the People of Boston and Saybrook,
Mr. Winthrop was appointed, by the Charter,
Governor of all Connecticut. Their joy, however,
<!--071.png--><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
sprung from different motives: Saybrook hoped for
effectual protection from the insults of Hertford and
the persecutions of Newhaven; and Boston expected
to govern the Governor.</p>

<p><!--072.png--><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
Mr. Winthrop settled at New-London, in the kingdom
of Sassacus, or colony of Saybrook, where he purchased
lands of the claimants under Lords Say and
Brook. Wisdom and moderation guided Mr. Winthrop.
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
He was annually elected Governor till his death, which
happened in 1676.</p>

<p>Whether it were owing to the discovery of any defect
in the title of the People of Connecticut to the
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>
soil, or of any undue arts practised in obtaining their
charter, or whether it must be considered as an instance
of Charles’s fickle or arbitrary disposition, that Monarch,
in the short space of two years after granting that
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
charter, comprized half Connecticut in another grant to
his brother, the Duke of York, of the territory between
the rivers Connecticut and Delaware, called by the
Dutch New-Netherlands. This step excited much discontent
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
in Connecticut, especially when an actual defalcation
of its territory was discovered to be in agitation,
after Colonel Nichols had succeeded in an enterprise he
was sent upon against the Dutch at New-York. Commissioners
<!--077.png--><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
were sent thither from Connecticut, the latter
end of 1664, to defend the interests of the Colony;
but, notwithstanding all the opposition they could make,
they were constrained to yield up the whole of Long-Island
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
and a strip of land on the east side of Hudson’s
river. This dismemberment is not easily to be justified;
but, probably, finding it necessary to the performance
of a promise he had made the Dutch of the enjoyment
<!--079.png--><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>
of their possessions, Nichols might think himself
at liberty of insisting upon it, furnished as he was with
almost regal powers as the Duke of York’s deputy. In
that capacity, he assumed the government of the conquered
<!--080.png--><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
territory, but does not appear to have intermeddled
further with that of Connecticut.</p>

<p>With Colonel Nichols were associated three other
gentlemen, in a commission, empowering them to enquire
<!--081.png--><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>
into the state of the New-England provinces, to
hear and redress complaints, settle differences, and
check abuses of power: but the ill humour and obstinacy
of those of Connecticut and Massachusets-Bay, in
a great measure frustrated their endeavours.</p>

<p><!--082.png--><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>
By authority of the Charter, the freemen chuse
annually, in May, a Governor, a Deputy-Governor, a
Secretary, a Treasurer, and 12 Assistants, and, twice a
year, two Representatives from each town. These, being
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>
met, constitute the General Assembly, which has
power to make laws, provided they are not repugnant
to the laws of England, and enforce them without the
consent of the King.</p>

<p>The General Assembly meets in May and October
without summoning. By it the colony has been divided
into six counties, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Hertford, Newhaven, New-London,
Fairfield, Windham, and Litchfield; and these
subdivided into 73 townships and 300 parishes.</p>

<p>Each town has two or more justices of peace, who
hear and determine, without a jury, all causes under 2<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span></p>

<!--084.png--><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>
<p>Each county has five judges, who try by a jury all
causes above 2<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span></p>

<p>Five judges preside over the superior court of the
province, who hold two sessions in each county every
year. To this court are brought appeals from the county
courts when the verdict exceeds 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> appeals from
the courts of probate, writs of error, petitions for divorce,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The General Assembly is a court of chancery, where
the error or rigour of the judgments of the superior
courts are corrected.</p>

<p>The General Assembly, and not the Governor, has
the power of life and death.</p>

<p>The courts of probate are managed by a justice of
peace appointed by the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Each county has its Sheriff, and each town its constables.</p>

<p>By charter the Governor is Captain-general of the
militia. Fourteen Colonels, 14 Lieutenant-Colonels,
and 14 Majors, are appointed by the General Assembly.
The Captains and Subalterns are elected by the People,
and commissioned by the Governor.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical courts in Connecticut are: 1.
The Minister and his Communicants; 2. The Association,
which is composed of every minister and deacon
in the county; 3. The Consociation, which consists of
four ministers and their deacons, chosen from each Association;
and always meets in May, at Hertford, with
the General Assembly. An appeal from the Consociation
will lie before the General Assembly; but the
clergy have always been against it, though with less
success than they wished.—The General Assembly declared
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>
“Sober Dissenters” to be the established religion
of the province.</p>

<p>The laws of the colony enacted by the authority of
the Charter are decent in comparison with the Blue
Laws. They make one thin volume in folio. Yet exceptions
may justly be made to many of them—equal
liberty is not given to all parties—taxes are unfairly
laid—the poor are oppressed.—One law is intolerable,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> When a trespass is committed in the night, the
injured person may recover damages of any-one he shall
think proper to accuse, unless the accused can prove an
alibi, or will clear himself by an oath; which oath, nevertheless,
it is at the option of the justice either to administer
or refuse. Queen Ann repealed the cruel laws
respecting Quakers, Ranters, and Adamites; but the
General Assembly, notwithstanding, continued the same
in their law-book, maintaining that a law made in Connecticut
could not be repealed by any authority but
their own. It is a ruled case with them that no law or
statute of England be in force in Connecticut till formally
passed by the General Assembly and recorded by
the Secretary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
Above 30 years ago, a negro castrated
his master’s son, and was brought to trial for it before
the Superior Court at Hertford. The Court could find
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
no law to punish the negro. The lawyers quoted the
English statute against maiming; the Court were of
opinion that statute did not reach this colony, because
it had not been passed in the General Assembly; and
therefore were about to remand the negro to prison till
the General Assembly should meet. But an <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-post-facto</span>
law was objected to as an infringement upon civil
liberty. At length, however, the Court were released
from their difficulty by having recourse to the vote of
the first settlers at Newhaven, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> That the Bible
should be their law till they could make others more
suitable to their circumstances. The court were of
opinion that vote was in full force, as it had not been
revoked; and thereupon tried the negro upon the Jewish
law, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Eye for Eye, and Tooth for Tooth. He
suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>The idea fostered by the colony of independence
on Great Britain was not, as might be imagined, destroyed
by the royal charter, but, on the contrary, was
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>
renewed and invigorated by it. Indeed, the charter is
as much in favour of Connecticut, and unfavourable to
England, as if it had been drawn up in Boston or Newhaven.
Had it been granted jointly by the King,
Lords, and Commons, and not by the King <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus</span>, no
one could dispute the independence of Connecticut on
England, any more than they could that of Holland on
Spain. The people at large did not discriminate between
an act of the King <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus</span> and an act of the King,
Lords, and Commons, conjointly; and, to prevent any-one
from shewing the difference, the General Assembly
made a law that “whoever should attempt to destroy
the constitution of this Colony as by charter established,
should suffer death.” The power of a British
King was held up by them much higher than the
constitution allowed. The King had authority, they
said, to form palatinate states without consent of Parliament.
Accustomed to doctrines of this tendency,
the multitude concluded the General Assembly of Connecticut
to be equal to the British Parliament.</p>

<p>Notions of this kind did not prevail in Connecticut
alone; Massachusets-Bay still more abounded with
them, and Rhode Island was not uninfected. What
was the consequence? Complaints against those governments
poured into the British court. A reformation,
therefore, became indispensable in New-England, and
was begun by a disfranchisement of the Massachusets
province. The death of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> put a temporary
stop to proceedings against the other colonies; but
James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> soon found it expedient to renew them. In
July, 1685, the following instances of mal-administration
were formally exhibited against the Governor and
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
Company of Connecticut, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, “They have made laws
contrary to the laws of England:—they impose fines
upon the inhabitants, and convert them to their own
use:—they enforce an oath of fidelity upon the inhabitants
without administering the oath of supremacy
and allegiance, as in their charter is directed:—they
deny to the inhabitants the exercise of the religion of
the church of England, arbitrarily fining those who
refuse to come to their congregational Assemblies:—his
Majesty’s subjects inhabiting there cannot obtain
justice in the courts of that colony:—they discourage
and exclude the government all gentlemen of known
loyalty, and keep it in the hands of the independent
party in the colony.” (<cite>New-Eng. Ent. vol.</cite> <abbr title="Two page">II. p.</abbr> 241.)
In consequence of this impeachment, James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> ordered
a <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</span> to be issued against the Charter of
Connecticut. The People perceived the King was in
earnest; and their alarm manifested itself in humble
sollicitations for favour: but, it being thought adviseable,
on several accounts, particularly the extensive
progress the French were making in Canada, to appoint
one general Governor over New-England, the
submissive applications of the Connecticut colonists
could no further be regarded than in allowing them
their choice, whether to be annexed to New-York or
the Massachusets. They preferred the latter; and, accordingly,
Sir Edmund Andros having been appointed
Captain-general over all New-England, the charter of
Connecticut was surrendered to him. It is very remarkable
that Mr. Neal, Hutchinson, and other historians
of New-England, have artfully passed over in
silence this transaction of the surrender of Connecticut
<!--089.png--><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
Charter to Sir Edmund Andros, the General Governor
over New-England. They have represented the
magistrates of Connecticut as not having resigned their
charter, but by an erroneous construction put on their
humble supplication to James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> by the Court of London;
whereas the fact is, they resigned it, <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria
forma</span>, into the hands of Sir Edmund Andros, at Hertford,
in October, 1687, and were annexed to the Massachusets-Bay
colony, in preference to New-York, according
to royal promise and their own petition.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
But
<!--090.png--><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
the very night of the surrender of it, Samuel Wadsworth,
of Hertford, with the assistance of a mob, violently broke
into the apartments of Sir Edmund, regained, carried
off, and hid the charter in the hollow of an elm; and,
in 1689, news arriving of an insurrection and overthrow
of Andros at Boston, Robert Treat, who had
been elected in 1687, was declared by the mob still to
be Governor of Connecticut. He daringly summoned
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
his old Assembly, who, being convened, voted the charter
to be valid in law, and that it could not be vacated
by any power without the consent of the General-Assembly<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>

They then voted that Samuel Wadsworth
should bring forth the charter; which he did in a solemn
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>
procession, attended by the High-sheriff, and delivered
it to the Governor. The General Assembly
voted their thanks to Wadsworth, and twenty shillings
as a reward for <em>stealing</em> and hiding their charter in the
elm. Thus Connecticut started from a dependent county
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>
into an independent province, in defiance of the authority
that had lately been paid such humble submission.
None should be surprized to find the People
shewing more deference to Abimeleck, King of Mohegin,
than to George, King of England; since a vote of
men, whose legislative and even corporate capacity had
been annihilated, has prevailed, for more than eighty
years, over a just exertion of royal prerogative.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
Nevertheless,
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>
this unconstitutional Assembly, whose authority
under an assumed charter has been tacitly acknowledged
by the British Parliament, have not at all times
been unchecked by the Corporation of Yale College.
That College, by a charter received from this self-erected
Government, was enabled to give Bachelors and
Masters degrees; but the Corporation have presumed
to give Doctors degrees. When the General Assembly
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
accused them of usurping a privilege not conferred by
their charter, they retorted that “to usurp upon a charter
was not so bad as to usurp a vacated charter.” The
General Assembly were obliged to be content with this
answer, as it contained much truth, and came from the
clergy, whose ambition and power are not to be trifled
with.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the reason of the English Government’s
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>
winking at the contempt shewn to their authority
by the people of Connecticut, it certainly added
to their ingratitude and bias to usurpation. Having been
in possession of that country one-hundred and forty years,
the General Assembly, though unsupported either by
law or justice, resolved to take up and settle their lands
west not only of Hudson but Susquehanna river, and
extending to the South-Sea. In pursuance of this resolution,
they with modesty passed over New-York, and
the Jerseys, because they are possessed by Mynheers
and fighting christians, and seized on Pensylvania,
claimed by Quakers, who fight not for either wife or
daughter. They filled up their fathers iniquities, by
murdering the Quakers and Indians, and taking possession
of their lands; and no doubt, in another century,
they will produce deeds of sale from Sunksquaw, Uncas,
or some other supposititious Sachem. This is a striking
instance of the use I have said the Colony sometimes
make of their charter, to countenance and support their
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>
adventurous spirit of enterprize. They plead that their
charter bounds them on the west by the South-Sea; but
they seem to have forgotten that their charter was surreptitiously
obtained; and that the clause on which
they dwell is rendered nugatory, by the petitioners
having described their lands as lying upon Connecticut
river, and obtained partly by purchase and partly by
conquest. Now, it being a fact beyond all controversy,
that they then had not conquered, nor even pretended
to have purchased, any lands west of Hudson’s-River,
it is evident that their westernmost boundary never did
or ought to extend further than to that river. Not
that Mr. Pen has any just title to those lands on Susquehanna
river which are the bone of contention, and
which lie north of his patent: they belong to the assigns
of the Plymouth Company, or to the Crown of
England.</p>

<p>Republicanism, schisms, and persecutions, have
ever prevailed in this Colony.—The religion of “<em>Sober
Dissenters</em>” having been established by the General Assembly,
each sect claimed the establishment in its favour.
The true Independents denied that the Assembly
had any further power over Christ’s Church than
to protect it. Few Magistrates of any religion are willing
to yield their authority to Ecclesiastics; and few
disciples of Luther or Calvin are willing to obey either
civil or spiritual masters. In a Colony where the people
are thus disposed, dominion will be religion, and
faction conscience. Hence arose contentions between
the Assembly and Independents; and both parties having
been brought up under Cromwell, their battles were
well fought. The independent Ministers published,
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>
from their pulpits, that the Assembly played off one
sect against another; and that Civilians were equal
enemies to all parties, and acted more for their own interest
than the glory of God. Those spiritual warriors,
by their Associations, fasting, and prayers, voted themselves
the “<span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>,” and got the better of the
General Assembly. Indeed, none disputed their vote
with impunity. Whenever a Governor manifested an
inclination to govern Christ’s Ministers, Christ’s Ministers
were sure to instruct the freemen not to reëlect
him. The Magistrates declared that they had rather be
under Lords-Bishops than Lords-Associations. A Governor
was appointed, who determined to reduce Christ’s
Ministers under the Civil Power; and, accordingly, the
Assembly sent their Sheriff to bring before them certain
leading men among the Ministers, of whom they
banished some, silenced others, and fined many, for
preaching sedition. The Ministers told the Assembly
that curst cows had short horns; and that “they were
<em>Priests for ever after the order of Melchisedec</em>.” However,
like good christians, they submitted to the sentence
of the Assembly; went home, fasted, and prayed,
until the Lord pointed out a perfect cure for all their
sufferings. On the day of election, they told the freemen
that the Lord’s cause required a man of Grace to
stand at the head of the Colony, and with sure confidence
recommended the Moderator of the Association
to be their Governor; and the Moderator was chosen.
This event greatly inflamed the lay-magistrates, who
were further mortified to see Ministers among the
Representatives; whereupon they cried out, “This is
a presbyterian popedom.” Now Magistrates joined
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>
with other Churches which they had long persecuted;
and the Connecticut Vine was rent more and more
every day. The Ministers kept the power, but not always
the office, of the Governor, whilst the weaker
party paid the cost. One party was called Old Light,
the other New Light: both aimed at power under pretence
of religion; which-ever got the power, the other
was persecuted. By this happy quarrel, the various
sectarians were freed from their persecutions; because
each contending party courted their votes and interest,
to help to pull down its adversary. This has been the
religious-political free system and practice of Connecticut
since 1662.</p>

<p>In speaking of the religious phrenzies and persecutions
in Connecticut under the sanction of the charter,
I must notice the words of an eminent Quaker,
who, as a blasphemer, had been whipped, branded,
burnt in the tongue, set on the gallows, banished, and,
upon return, sentenced to be hanged. “Dost thee not
think,” said he to his Judges, “that the Jews, who
crucified the Saviour of the World, had a <em>Charter</em>?”</p>

<p>Many have been the disputes between Connecticut
and the neighbouring Colonies concerning their several
boundaries, and much blood has been spilt on those occasions.
On the north and east, where lie the Massachusets
and Rhode-Island, Connecticut has, in some
degree, been the gainer; but has lost considerably on
the west and south, to the engendering violent animosity
against the <em>loyal</em> New-Yorkers, to whom it will
probably prove fatal in the end. The detail is briefly
as follows:</p>

<p>The Dutch settlers on New-York Island, Hudson’s
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>
river, and the west end of Long Island, being subdued
by Colonel Nichols in September, 1664, the royal Commissioners,
after hearing the Deputies from Connecticut
in support of the charter granted to that province
against the Duke of York’s patent, ordered, in December
following, that Long-Island should be annexed to
the government of New-York, and that the West boundary
of Connecticut should be a line drawn from the
mouth of Mamaroneck river north-north-west to the
line of the Massachusets. This settlement, although it
infringed their charter, was peaceably acquiesced in by
the people of Connecticut; and not complained of by
those of New-York till 1683, when they set up a claim
founded upon a Dutch grant, <em>said</em> to be made in 1621,
of all the lands from Cape Cod to Cape Henlopen. In
furtherance of their pretensions, they had recourse to invasion
and slander. Of the latter Mr. Smith has given
a specimen in his History of New-York, where he says
that the agreement in 1664 “was founded in ignorance
and fraud;” because, forsooth, “a north-north-west
line from Mamaroneck would soon intersect Hudson’s
river!” Could any one of common-sense suppose
the Dutch on the banks of Hudson’s river, who
no doubt were consulted upon the occasion, less acquainted
with the course of it, than persons residing on
the banks of the Connecticut? Extraordinarily absurd
as such an insinuation might be, the people of Connecticut
were aware of its probable weight with the Duke
of York, whose patent grasped half their country; and
therefore, knowing by whom a contest must be decided,
they consented to give up twenty miles of their land
east of Hudson’s river, hoping that would content a
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
company of time-serving Jacobites and artful Dutchmen.
But neither were they nor their Patron satisfied;
and the agreement was suspended till 1700, when it
was confirmed by William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> About twenty years
afterwards, however, the New-Yorkers thought the
times favourable to further encroachments; and at
length, in 1731, they gained 60,000 acres more, called
the Oblong, from Connecticut, purely because they had
Dutch consciences, and for once reported in England
what was true, that the New-England colonists hated
Kings, whether natives or foreigners. Mr. Smith, indeed,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 238, says, referring to Douglas’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
Plan of the
British Dominions of New-England in support of his assertion,
that “Connecticut ceeded these 60,000 acres to
New-York, as an <em>equivalent</em> for lands near the Sound
<em>surrendered</em> to Connecticut, by New-York.” Mr.
Smith, and all the New-York cabal, know, that there
never were any lands in the possession of the New-Yorkers
<em>surrendered</em> to Connecticut: on the contrary,
Connecticut was forced, by the partiality of sovereigns,
to give up, not only Long-Island and the above-mentioned
twenty miles east of Hudson’s river, but also
the Oblong, without any <em>equivalent</em>. How New-York
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
could surrender lands and tenements which they never
had any right to or possession of, is only to be explained
thus: whereas the people of New-York did not extend
their eastern boundary to Connecticut river, they therefore
<em>surrendered</em> to Connecticut what they never had;
which is like a highwayman’s saying to a Gentleman,
Give me ten guineas, and I will <em>surrender</em> to you your
watch in your pocket.</p>

<p>Thus by degrees has Connecticut lost a tract of land
sixty miles in length and above twenty in breadth, together
with the whole of Long-Island; and this in the
first place by a stretch of royal prerogative, and afterwards
by the chicanery of their competitors, who have
broken through all agreements as often as a temporising
conduct seemed to promise them success. Whenever,
therefore, a favourable opportunity presents itself, it is
probable, that Messrs. Smith and Livingston, and other
pateroons in New-York, will find the last determination
also to have been “founded in ignorance and fraud,”
and will be pushing their claim to all the lands west
of Connecticut river; but the opportunity must be favourable
indeed, that allows them to encroach one foot
farther with impunity.</p>

<p>Another stroke the people of Connecticut received
about 1753 has sorely galled them ever since, and contributed
not a little to their thirst of revenge. The
Governor of New-York was then appointed “Captain-General
and Commander in Chief of the militia, and
all the forces by sea and land, within the Colony of
Connecticut, and of all the forts and places of strength
within the same.” This violation of the Charter of
Connecticut by George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was very extraordinary, as
<!--103.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
the reins of Government were then in the hands of
protestant dissenters, whose <em>supposed</em> veneration for
the House of Hanover operated so powerfully, that
the American protestant dissenting ministers were allowed
to be installed teachers, and to hold synods,
without taking the oath of allegiance to the English
King, at the same time that papists, and even members
of the Church of England, were not excused that obligation.
The aggravating appointment above mentioned
added no celebrity to the name of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in New-England;
nor, however excusable it may appear in the
eyes of those who with me question the colonial pretensions
of the people of Connecticut, was it, upon the
ground they have been allowed to stand by the English
government, justifiable in point of right, nor yet in
point of policy, were the true character of the New-Yorkers
fully known. This argument may be used on
more occasions than the present.</p>

<p>But Connecticut hath not been the only sufferer
from the restless ambition of New-York. Twenty
miles depth of land belonging to the Massachusets
and Newhampshire provinces, which formerly claimed
to Hudson’s river, were cut off by the line that deprived
Connecticut of the same proportion of its western
territory. With this acquisition, surely, the New-Yorkers
might have been content; but very lately their
<em>wisdom</em>, if not their “fraud,” has prevailed over the
“ignorance” of Newhampshire; which has sustained
another amputation of its territory, eighty miles in
width and two hundred miles in length; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> all the
land between the above-mentioned twenty-mile line
and Connecticut river. The particulars of this transaction
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>
are interesting. Benning Wentworth, Esq.
Governor of Newhampshire, by order of his present
Majesty, divided, in 1762, the vast tract of land just
mentioned into about 360 townships, six miles square
each. These townships he granted to proprietors belonging
to the four provinces of New-England, one
township to sixty proprietors; and took his fees for
the same, according to royal appointment. Every
township was, in twelve years time, to have sixty families
residing in it. In 1769 there were settled on this
piece of land 30,000 souls, at a very great expence;
and many townships contained 100 families. The
New-Yorkers found means to deceive the King, and
obtained a decree that the East boundary of New-York,
after passing Connecticut and Massachusets-Bay, should
be Connecticut river.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
This decree annexed to the jurisdiction
of New-York the said 360 townships; but
was quietly submitted to by the proprietors, since it
was his Majesty’s will to put them under the jurisdiction
of New-York, tho’ they found themselves 150
miles farther from their new capital New-York, than
they were from Portsmouth, their old one. Had the
New-Yorkers rested satisfied with the jurisdiction,
which alone the King had given them, they might
have enjoyed their acquisition in peace; and New-England
would have thought they had possessed some justice,
though destitute of religious zeal. But the Governor
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
and General Assembly of New-York, finding
their interest in Old-England stronger than the interest
of the New-Englanders, determined at once, that, as
the King had given them jurisdiction over those 360
townships, he had also given them the lands in fee
simple. Sir Henry More, the Governor, therefore, in
1767, began the laudable work of regranting those
townships to such people as lived in New-York, and
were willing to pay him 600<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> York currency for his
valuable name to each patent. It is remarkable that
Sir Harry made every <em>lawyer</em> in the whole province a
patentee; but totally <em>forgot</em> the four public lots, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
that for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel,
those for the church, the first clergyman, and school in
each township, which had been reserved in Governor
Wentworth’s grants. Death stopped his career; but
Colden, the Lieutenant-Governor, filled up the measure
of his iniquity, by granting all the rest on the same
conditions. Sir Henry More had taken care to grant
to his dear self one township, settled with above 80
families, before he died. Colden did the same for himself.
The virtuous William Smith, Esq. of New York,
had a township also; and Sir Henry More left him his
executor to drive off the New-England settlers. This,
however, he attempted in vain. The polite New-Yorkers,
having the jurisdiction, betook themselves to law,
to get possession of the lands in question, which they
called their own; and sent the posse of Albany to eject
the possessors; but this mighty power was answered by
Ethan Allen, and the old proprietors under Governor
Wentworth, who was a King’s Governor as well as Sir
Henry More:—the Mynheers of Albany were glad to
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>
have liberty to return home alive.—See here the origin
of Ethan Allen!—of the Verdmonts, and the Robbers
of the Green Mountains; a compliment paid by the
New-Yorkers to the settlers under Governor Wentworth;—who,
on that amiable gentleman’s death, had
no friend of note left in England, and were therefore
under the necessity of defending themselves, or becoming
tenants to a set of people who neither <em>feared God</em>
nor <em>honoured the King</em>, but when they got something
by it.—The New-Yorkers had the grace, after this, to
outlaw Ethan Allen, which rendered him of consequence
in New-England; and it would not surprise me
to hear that New-York, Albany, and all that the Dutchmen
possess in houses east of Hudson’s River, were consumed
by fire, and the inhabitants sent to Heaven, in
the style of Dr. Mather, by the way of Amsterdam.
I must do the New-Englanders the justice to say, that,
though they esteem not highly Kings or Lords, yet they
never complained against his Majesty for what was done
respecting Verdmont; on the contrary, they ever said
the King would reverse the obnoxious decree, whenever
he should be acquainted with the truth of the case,
which the New-Yorkers artfully concealed from his
knowledge.</p>

<p>There are in the four New-England provinces near
800,000 souls, and very few unconnected with the
settlements on Verdmont; the property of which was
duly vested in them by Wentworth, the King’s Governor,
whose predecessors and himself had jurisdiction
over it also for 106 years. They say, what is
very legal and just, that his Majesty had a right to
annex Verdmont to the government of New-York, but
<!--107.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
could not give the fee of the land, because he had before
given it to the New-Englanders. It appears very
unlikely that those hardy sons of Oliver will ever give
up Verdmont to the New-Yorkers by the order of Sir
Henry More, or any other Governor, till compelled by
the point of the sword. The Mynheers have more to
fear than the New-Englanders, who will never yield to
Dutch virtue. Van Tromp was brave; Oliver was
brave and successful too.</p>

<p>Mather, Neal, and Hutchinson, represent religion
to have been the cause of the first settlement of New-England;
and the love of gold as the stimulus of the
Spaniards in settling their colonies in the southern parts
of America; but, if we should credit the Spanish historians,
we must believe that their countrymen were as
much influenced by religion in their colonial pursuits
as were our own. However, in general, it may be said,
that the conduct of both parties towards the aborigines
discovered no principles but what were disgraceful to
human nature. Murder, plunder, and outrage, were the
means made use of to convert the benighted savages of
the wilderness to the system of Him “who went about
doing good.” If we may depend on Abbé Nicolle, the
Spaniards killed of the Aytis, or the savage nations, in
the Island of Hispaniola, 3,000,000 in seventeen years;
600,000 in Porto Rico, and twenty times these numbers
on the continent of South-America, in order to propagate
the Gospel in a savage and howling wilderness!
The English colonists have been as industrious in
spreading the Gospel in the howling wilderness of
North-America. Upwards of 180,000 Indians, at least,
have been slaughtered in Massachusets-Bay and Connecticut,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>

<!--108.png--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>
to make way for the protestant religion; and,
upon a moderate computation for the rest of the colonies,
on the continent and West-India Islands, I think
one may venture to assert, that nearly 2,000,000 savages
have been dismissed from an unpleasant world to
the world of spirits, for the honour of the protestant
religion and English liberty. Nevertheless, having
travelled over most parts of British America, I am able
to declare, with great sincerity, that this mode of converting
the native Indians is godlike in comparison
with that adopted by the Africans.</p>

<p>These miserable people are first kidnapped, and then
put under saws, harrows, and axes of iron, and forced
through the brick-kiln to Molock.</p>

<p>Nearly half a million of them are doomed to hug
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>
their misery in ignorance, nakedness, and hunger,
among their master’s upper servants in Georgia, the
Carolinas, Virginia, and Maryland. The number of these
wretches upon the Continent and Islands is scarce credible;
about 100,000 in Jamaica alone; all toiling for the
tyrant’s pleasure; none seeking other happiness, than
to be screened from the torture rendered necessary by
that curious American maxim, that men must be willing
to die before they are fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.
However, what Mussleman, African, or American, would
not prefer the state of a christian master, who dreads
death above all things, to the state of those christian
converts? Christianity has been cursed, through the
insincerity of its professors; even savages despise its
precepts, because they have no influence on christians
themselves. Whatever religious pretensions the Spanish,
French, or English may plead for depopulating and
repeopling America, it is pretty clear that the desire of
gold and dominion was no impotent instigation with
them to seek the western continent. The British leaders
in the scheme of emigration had felt the humiliating
effects of the feudal system; particularly the partial
distributions of fortunes and honour among children of
the same venter in the Mother Country. They had seen
that this inequality produced insolence and oppression,
which awakened the sentiments of independence and
liberty, the instinct of every man. Nature then kindled
war against the oppressors, and the oppressors appealed
to prescription. The event was, infelicity began her
reign. Both parties invoked religion, but prostrated
themselves before the insidious shrine of Superstition,
the life of civil government, and the sinews of war;
<!--110.png--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
that expiates crimes by prayers, uses ceremonies for good
works, esteems devotion more than virtue, supports religion
without probity, values honesty less than honour,
generates happiness without morality, and is a glorious
helmet to the ambitious.</p>

<p>They enlisted vassals with her bounty to fight,
burn, and destroy one another, for the sake of religion.
Behold the sequel! The vassals seemed more
to themselves than the Egyptian masters and laws,
both in the elder and younger brothers; yet, after
all, Superstition told them they enjoyed liberty and
the rights of human nature. Happy deception! The
Spartan Magnates, tributary to the Turks, are jealous
of their liberties; while the American Cansey, near
Lake Superior, enjoy liberty complete without jealousy.
Among the latter, the conscious independence of each
individual warms his thoughts and guides his actions.
He enters the sachemic dome with the same simple
freedom as he enters the wigwam of his brother:
neither dazzled at the splendour nor awed by the power
of the possessor. Here is liberty in perfection! What
christian would wish to travel 4000 miles to rob an
unoffending savage of what he holds by the law of
Nature? That is not the God or Dominion that any
christian ever sought for. The first settlers of America
had views very different from those of making it a
christian country; their grand aim was to get free from
the insolence of their elder brethren, and to aggrandise
themselves in a new world at the expense of the life,
liberty, and property of the savages. Had the invaders
of New-England sown the seeds of christian benevolence,
even after they had eradicated the savages and
<!--111.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>
savage virtues, the world would not have reproached
them for cherishing that all-grasping spirit to themselves,
which in others had driven them from their
parent country. But the feudal system, which they
considered an abominable vice in England, became a
shining virtue on the other side of the Atlantic, and
would have prevailed there, had the people been as blind
and tame in worldly as they were in spiritual concerns.
But they had too long heard their leaders declaim
against the monopoly of lands and titles, not to discover
that they themselves were men, and entitled to the
rights of that race of beings; and they proceeded upon
the same maxims which they found also among the Indians,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that mankind are by nature upon an equality
in point of rank and possession; that it is incompatible
with freedom for any particular descriptions of men systematically
to monopolise honours and property, to the
exclusion of the rest; that it was a part despicable and
unworthy of one freeman to stoop to the will and caprice
of another on account of his wealth and titles, accruing
not from his own, but from the heroism and virtue of
his ancestors, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</span> established these maxims in New-England;
and whoever did not, at least outwardly, conform
to them, were not chosen into office. Nay, though
not objectionable on that score, men very seldom met
with reappointments, lest they should claim them by
hereditary right. Thus, the levelling principle prevailing,
equals were respected and superiors derided. Europeans,
whose manners were haughty to inferiors and
fawning to superiors, were neither loved nor esteemed.
Hence an English traveller through Connecticut meets
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>
with supercilious treatment at taverns, as being too
much addicted to the use of the imperative mood when
speaking to the landlord. The answer is, “Command
your own servants, and not me.” The traveller is
not obeyed, which provokes him to some expressions,
that are not legal in the Colony, about the impertinence
of the landlord, who being commonly a Justice of the
Peace, the delinquent is immediately ordered into custody,
fined, and put in the stocks. However, after paying
costs, and promising to behave well in future, he
passes on with more attention to his “unruly member”
than to his pleasures. Nevertheless, if a traveller softens
his tone, and avoids the imperative mood, he will find
every civility from those very people, whose natural
temper are full of antipathy against all who affect
superiority over them. This principle is, by long custom,
blended with the religious doctrines of the province;
and the people believe those to be heretics and
Americans who assent not to their supremacy. Hence
they consider the kingly Governors as the short-horns of
Antichrist, and every Colony in a state of persecution
which cannot choose its own Governor and magistrates.</p>

<p>Their aversion to New-York is inconceiveably great
upon this account, as well as others I have mentioned.
Their jealousies and fears of coming under its jurisdiction
make them heroes in the cause of liberty, and great
inquisitors into the characters and conduct of kingly
Governors. They have selected Mr. Tryon as the only
English Governor who has acted with justice and generosity
in respect to the rights, liberties, and feelings of
mankind, while, they say, avarice, plunder, and oppression
have marked the footsteps of all the rest. This
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>
character Mr. Tryon possessed, even after he had subdued
the regulators in North-Carolina, and was appointed
Governor of New-York. Some persons assert,
indeed, that he secured the good will of Connecticut by
recommending, in England, the Livingstons, Schuylers,
and Smiths, as the best subjects in New-York. However,
Mr. Tryon was undoubtedly entitled to good report;
he was humane and polite; to him the injured
had access without a fee; he would hear the poor man’s
complaint, though it wanted the aid of a polished lawyer.
Besides, Mr. Tryon did not think it beneath him
to speak to a peasant in the street, or to stop his coach
to give the people an opportunity to let him pass. His
object was not to make his fortune, nor did he neglect
the interests of the people. He embellished not his language
with oaths and curses, nor spent the Sabbath at
taverns. ’Tis true, Mr. Tryon went not to meeting;
but he was forgiven this offence because he went to
church, the people of New-England having so much
candour as to believe a man may be a good sort of man
if he goes to church, and is exemplary in his words and
deeds. I have not the honour of being known to Mr.
Tryon, but from what I know of him, I must say, without
meaning to offend any other, that he was the best
Governor, and the most pleasing gentleman, that I ever
saw in a civil capacity in America; and that I cannot
name any Briton so well calculated to govern in Connecticut,
with ease and safety to himself, as he is. One
reason for this assertion is, that Mr. Tryon has a punctilious
regard for his word: a quality which, though
treachery is the staple commodity of the four New-England
provinces, the people greatly admire in a Governor,
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>
and which, they say, they have seldom found in
royal Governors in America.</p>

<p>Of the share Connecticut has taken, in common
with her sister colonies, in co-operating with the Mother
Country against her natural enemies, it is superfluous
to say anything here, that being already sufficiently
known.</p>

<p>I shall therefore proceed to a description of the
country, its towns, productions, &amp;c. together with the
manners, customs, commerce, &amp;c. of the inhabitants,
interspersing such historical and biographical anecdotes
as may occur to me in the relation, and having a tendency
to elucidate matter of fact or characterize the
people.</p>

<p>The dimensions of Connecticut, according to the
present allowed extent, are from the Sound on the
south to the Massachusets line on the north, about
sixty miles; and from Biram River and New-York line,
on the west, to Narraganset-Bay, Rhode-Island, and
Massachusets-Bay on the east, upon an average about
one hundred miles. It is computed to contain 5,000,000
acres.</p>

<p>Many creeks and inlets, bays and rivers, intersect
the coast. Three of the last, dividing the colony into
as many parts, I shall particularly notice. They all run
from north to south.</p>

<p>The eastern river is called the Thames, as far as it
is navigable, which is only to Norwich, fourteen miles
from its mouth. Then dividing, the greatest branch,
called Quinnibaug, rolls rapidly from its source 100
miles distant through many towns and villages, to their
great pleasantness and profit. On it are many mills
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>
and iron-works, and in it various kinds of fish, but no
salmon, for want of proper places to nourish their
spawn.</p>

<p>The middle river is named Connecticut, after the
great Sachem to whom that part of the province through
which it runs belonged. This vast river is five hundred
miles long, and four miles wide at its mouth; its channel,
or inner banks, in general, half a mile wide. It
takes its rise from the White Hills, in the north of
New-England, where also springs the river Kennebec.
About five hundred rivulets, which issue from lakes,
ponds, and drowned lands, fall into it; many of them
are larger than the Thames at London. In March,
when the rains and sun melt the snow and ice, each
stream is overcharged, and kindly hastens to this great
river, to overflow, fertilize, and preserve its trembling
meadows. They lift enormous cakes of ice, bursting
from their frozen beds, with threatening intentions of
ploughing up the frighted earth, and carry them rapidly
down the falls, where they are dashed in pieces and
rise in mist. Except at these falls, of which there are
five the first sixty miles from its mouth, the river is
navigable throughout. In its northern part are three
great bendings, called Cohosses, about one hundred miles
asunder. Two hundred miles from the Sound is a narrow
of five yards only, formed by two shelving mountains
of solid rock, whose tops intercept the clouds.
Through this chasm are compelled to pass all the waters
which, in the time of the floods, bury the northern
country.</p>

<p>At the upper Cohos the river spreads twenty-four
miles wide. For five or six weeks ships of war might
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
sail over the lands that afterward produce the greatest
crops of hay and grain in all America. People who
can bear the sight, the groans, the tremblings, and
surly motion of water, trees, and ice, through this awful
passage, view with astonishment one of the greatest
phenomenons in Nature. Here, water consolidated
without frost, by pressure, by swiftness, between the
pinching, sturdy rocks, to such a degree of induration
that an iron crow cannot be forced into it; here, iron,
lead, and cork, have one common weight; here, steady
as time, and harder than marble, the stream passes irresistible,
if not swift as lightning; the electric fire
rends trees in pieces with no greater ease than does this
mighty water. The passage is about four hundred
yards in length, and of a zigzag form, with obtuse corners.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--117.png--><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
At high water are carried through this straight
masts and other timber with incredible swiftness, and
sometimes with safety; but when the water is too low,
the masts, timber, and trees, strike on one side or the
other, and, though of the largest size, are rent, in one
moment, into shivers, and splintered like a broom, to
the amazement of spectators. The meadows, for many
miles below, are covered with immense quantities of
wood thus torn in pieces, which compel the hardiest
travellers to reflect, how feeble is man, and how great
that Almighty who formed the lightnings, thunders,
and the irresistible power and strength of waters!</p>

<p>No living creature was ever known to pass through
this narrow, except an Indian woman, who was, in a
canoe, attempting to cross the river above it, but carelessly
suffered herself to fall within the power of the
current. Perceiving her danger, she took a bottle of
rum she had with her, and drank the whole of it; then
lay down in her canoe, to meet her destiny. She marvellously
went through safely, and was taken out of the
canoe some miles below, quite intoxicated, by some
Englishmen. Being asked how she could be so daringly
imprudent as to drink such a quantity of rum with the
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
prospect of instant death before her, the squaw, as well
as her condition would let her, replied, “Yes, it was too
much rum for once, to be sure; but I was not willing
to lose a drop of it: so I drank it, and you see I have
saved all.”</p>

<p>Some persons assert that salmon have been caught
above this narrow, while others deny it. Many have
observed salmon attempt to pass in the time of floods,
which certainly is the best and likeliest time, as, from
the height of the water, and the shelving of the rocks,
the passage is then broader; but they were always
thrown back, and generally killed. It is not to be supposed
that any fish could pass with the stream alive.
Above this narrow there is plenty of fish both in summer
and winter, which belong to the lakes or ponds
that communicate with the river: below it are the
greatest abundance and variety caught or known in
North-America. No salmon are found in any river to
the westward of this.</p>

<p>Except the Mississippi and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, the Connecticut
is the largest river belonging to the English
plantations in the New World. On each shore of it
are two great roads leading from the mouth 200 miles
up the country, lined on both sides with the best-built
houses in America, if not in the world. It is computed,
that the country on each bank of this river, to a
depth of six miles, and a length of 300, is sufficient for
the maintenance of an army of 100,000 men. In short,
the neighbouring spacious and fertile meadow, arable,
and other lands, combined with this noble river, are at
once the beauty and main support of all New-England.</p>

<p>The western river is navigable and called Stratford
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>
only for ten miles, where Derby stands; and then
takes the name of Osootonoc. It is 50 miles west from
Connecticut River, and half a mile wide. It rises in the
Verdmonts, above 200 miles from the sea, and travels
300 miles through many pleasant towns and villages.
The adjacent meadows are narrow, and the country in
general very hilly. With some expence it might be
made navigable above 100 miles. It furnishes fish of
various kinds, and serves many mills and iron-works.</p>

<p>Two principal bays, named Sassacus or New-London,
and Quinnipiog or Newhaven, run five or six
miles into the country, and are met by rivers which
formerly bore the Sachems names.</p>

<p>It has already been observed, that Connecticut was
settled under three distinct independent Governors;
and that each Dominion, since their union in 1664, has
been divided into two counties.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kingdom of Sassacus</span>, Sachem of the Pequods,
a warlike nation, forms the counties of New-London
and Windham, which contain about 10,000 houses, and
60,000 inhabitants. Sassacus was brave by nature. The
sound of his coming would subdue nations, at the same
time that Justice would unbend his bow, and Honour
calm the thunder of his tongue. Dr. Mather, Mr. Neal,
and others, have endeavoured to blast his fame by
proving him to have been the aggressor in the bloody
wars which ended in his ruin. They have instanced
the murder of Captain Stone and others, to justify this
war, but carefully concealed the assassination of Quinnipiog,
the treachery of Mr. Elliot (the Massachusets-Bay
Apostle of the Indians), and the infamous villainy
of Hooker, who spread death upon the leaves of his
<!--120.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>
Bible, and struck Connecticote mad with disease. They
also conceal another important truth, that the English
had taken possession of lands belonging to Sassacus,
without purchase or his consent. Besides, Sassacus had
too much sagacity to let christian spies, under the appellation
of gospel missionaries, pass through his country.
He had seen the consequences of admitting such
ministers of christianity from Boston, Hertford, &amp;c.
among his neighbouring nations, and generously warned
them to keep their gospel of peace from his dominions.
The invaders of this howling wilderness, finding their
savage love detected, and that the Pequods were not
likely to fall a sacrifice to their hypocrisy, proclaimed
open war with sword and gun. The unfortunate Sassacus
met his fate. Alas! he died, not like Connecticote,
nor Quinnipiog, but in the field of battle; and
the freedom of his country expired with his final groan.
This mighty conquest was achieved by the colonists of
Connecticut, without the aid of the Massachusets; nevertheless,
Mr. Neal and others have ascribed the <em>honour</em>
of it to the latter, with a view of magnifying their
consequence—ever Mr. Neal’s grand object.</p>

<p>The country of New-London abounds chiefly with
wool, butter, cheese, and Indian-corn; and contains
eight towns, all which I shall describe.</p>

<p><span class="location">New-London</span> has the river Thames on the east, and
the bay of its own name on the south, and resembles
Islington. Its port and harbour are the best in the
colony. The church, the meeting, and court-house,
are not to be boasted of; the fort is trifling. The
houses in this, as in all the towns in the province, are
insulated, at the distance of three, four, or five yards
<!--121.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
one from the other, to prevent the ravages of fire.
That of John Winthrop, Esq. is the best in the province.
The township is ten miles square, and comprizes
five parishes, one of which is episcopal. Abimeleck, a
descendant of the first English-made king of Mohegin,
resides with his small party in this township. He is a
king to whom the people pay some respect,—<em>because
they made him so</em>.</p>

<p>The people of this town have the credit of inventing
tar and feathers as a proper punishment for heresy.
They first inflicted it on quakers and anabaptists.</p>

<p>New-London has a printing press, much exercised
in the business of pamphlets, sermons, and newspapers.
It is employed by the Governor and Company,
and is the oldest and best in the colony. Newhaven,
Hertford, and Norwich, also, have each a printing
press; so that the people are plentifully supplied with
news, politics, and polemical divinity.—&#8203;—A very extraordinary
circumstance happened here in 1740. Mr.
George Whitefield paid them a visit, and preached of
<em>righteousness</em>, <em>temperance</em>, and <em>a judgment to come</em>,
which roused them into the belief of an heaven and an
hell. They became as <em>children weaned</em> and pliable as
<em>melted wax</em>, and with great eagerness cried out, <em>What
shall we do to be saved?</em> The preacher, then in the
pulpit, thus answered them, “Repent—do violence to
no man—part with your self-righteousness, your silk
gowns, and laced petticoats—burn your ruffles, necklaces,
jewels, rings, tinselled waistcoats, your morality
and bishops books, this very night, or damnation will
be your portion before the morning-dawn.” The people,
rather thro’ fear than faith, instantly went out on
<!--122.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span>
the common, and prepared for heaven, by burning all
the above <em>enumerated goods</em>, excepting that of self-righteousness,
which was exchanged for the preacher’s
velvet breeches.—Vide <em>Dr. Chancy</em>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="location">Groton</span>, across the bay from New-London, resembles
Battersea. The township is ten miles square, and
forms four parishes, one of which is episcopal. This
town was the residence of the valiant Sassacus, Sachem
of the Pequod nation.</p>

<p><span class="location">Stonington</span> lies on Narraganset-Bay, is the east corner
of Connecticut, and consists of three parishes. The
township is 8 miles square.</p>

<p><!--123.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
<span class="location">Preston</span>, on Quinnibaug river, forms three parishes,
one of which is episcopal. The township is 8 miles
square.</p>

<p><span class="location">Norwich</span>, on the Thames, 14 miles from the sea,
is an half-shire with New-London. The town stands
on a plain, one mile from Chelsea, or the Landing. Its
best street is two miles long, and has good houses on
both sides, five yards asunder from each other. In the
centre is a common, of the size of Bloomsbury Square,
in which stand a beautiful court-house, and a famous
meeting with clocks, bells, and steeples. The township
is fifteen miles square, and forms 13 parishes, one
episcopal. Chelsea, or the Landing, resembles Dover.
[Here land is sold at fifteen shillings sterling by the
square foot.]—This town is famous for its trade; for
iron-works, grist, paper, linseed, spinning and fulling
mills; also for a furnace that makes stone ware.—&#8203;—Some
peculiarities and curiosities here attract the notice
of Europeans:—1, a bridge over Quinnibaug, 60 yards
long, butted on two rocks, and geometrically supported;
under which pass ships with all their sails standing:—2,
the steeple of the grand meeting-house stands at the
east end:—3, the inhabitants bury the dead with their
feet to the west.—The following couplet was written
by a traveller, on the steeple:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="indent0a">“They’re so perverse and opposite,</div>
 <div class="indent0">As if they built to God in spite.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The reasons for the singular custom of burying the
dead with their feet to the west, are two, and special:
first, when Christ begins his millenarian reign, he will
come from the west, and his saints will be in a ready
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
posture to rise and meet him: secondly, the papists and
episcopalians bury their dead with their feet to the east.</p>

<p>Was I to give a character of the people of Norwich,
I would do it in the words of the famous Mr.
George Whitefield, (who was a good judge of mankind,)
in his farewel-sermon to them a short time before his
death; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “When I first preached in this magnificent
house, above 20 years ago, I told you, that you were
part beast, part man, and part devil; at which you
were offended. I have since thought much about
that expression, and confess that for once I was mistaken.
I therefore take this last opportunity to correct
my error. Behold! I now tell you, that you are
not part man and part beast, but wholly of the devil.”</p>

<p><span class="location">Lyme</span> stands on the east side of Connecticut River,
opposite Saybrook; and resembles Lewisham. The
township is 16 miles long, and 8 wide; and forms four
parishes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Saybrook</span> is situated on the west side of Connecticut
river, 20 miles west from New-London, and resembles
Battersea. The township is twenty miles long
and six wide, and forms four parishes. This town was
named after the Lords Say and Brook, who were said
to claim the country, and sent, in 1634, a Governor and
a large number of people from England to build a fort
and settle the colony. See <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17. It was principally
owing to this fort that Hertford and Newhaven made
good their settlements: it prevented Sassacus from giving
timely aid to Connecticote and Quinnipiog.</p>

<p>Saybrook is greatly fallen from its ancient grandeur;
but is, notwithstanding, resorted to with great
veneration, as the parent town of the whole colony.
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>
The tombs of the first settlers are held sacred, and
travellers seldom pass them without the compliment of
a sigh or tear. On one mossy stone is written,</p>

<p class="center">“Here pride is calm’d, and death is life.”</p>

<p>In 1709, this town was honoured by a convention
of contending independent divines, who were pleased
with no constitution in church or state.—This multitude
of sectarians, after long debates, published a book,
called The Saybrook Platform, containing the doctrines
and rules of the churches in Connecticut. The only
novelty in this system is, that Christ has delegated his
ministerial, kingly, and prophetical power, one half to
the people, and the other half to the ministers. This
proposition may be thought in Europe a very strange
one; but, if it be recollected, that the people in the
province claimed all power in heaven and on earth, and
that the ministers had no other ordination than what
came from the people, it will appear, that the ministers
hereby gained from the people one half of their power.
From this article originated the practice of the
right hand of fellowship at the ordination of a minister.
No one can be a minister, till he receives the right
hand of the messenger who represents six deacons from
six congregations. The conclusion of this reverend
and venerable body is, “The Bible is our rule.”</p>

<p>Mr. Neal says, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 610, “That every particular society
is a compleat church, having power to exercise
all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, without appeal to any
classis:—they allow of synods for council and advice,
but not to exercise the power of the keys.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Neal had taken the trouble to read the
<!--126.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
History of the Church of Massachusets-Bay, written
by the Reverend Mr. John Wise, a minister of that
church, he would have found that the contrary to all he
has advanced is the truth. The people of that province
held the keys from 1620 to 1650: then the ministers
got possession of them by their own vote, which was
passed into a law by the General Assembly. The vote
was, “There cannot be a minister, unless he is ordained
by ministers of Jesus Christ.” Thus commenced ordination
by ministers in New-England. The people
were alarmed at the loss of the keys, and asked the
ministers who had ordained them? The ministers answered,
The people. Then, replied the people, we are
the ministers of Jesus Christ, you are not ministers;
and we will keep the power. A violent contest ensued
between the people and the ministers; but the latter,
by the help of the General Assembly, retained the
power of the keys, and instituted three ecclesiastical
courts, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 1, the minister and his communicants; 2,
the associations; and 3, the synod. There lies an appeal
from one to the other of these courts, all which
exercise so much ecclesiastical power that few are easy
under it. The first court suspends from communion,
the second re-hears the evidence, and confirms or sets
aside the suspension; the synod, after hearing the case
again, excommunicates or discharges the accused. From
the last judgment no appeal is allowed by the synod.
The excommunicated person has no other resource than
petitioning the General Assembly of the province,
which sometimes grants relief, to the great grief of the
synod and ministers. But the representatives commonly
pay dear for overlooking the conduct of the synod
at the next election.</p>

<p><!--127.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
The people of Connecticut have adopted the same
mode of discipline as prevails in Massachusets-Bay, but
call the synod a Consociation.</p>

<p>To show that the synods are not quite so harmless
as Mr. Neal reports, I will give an instance of their
authority exercised in Connecticut in 1758. A Mr.
Merret, of Lebanon, having lost his wife, with whom
he had lived childless forty years, went to Rhode-Island,
and married a niece of his late wife, which was agreeable
to the laws of that province. By her having a
child, Mr. Merret offered the same for baptism to the
minister of whose church he was a member. The minister
refused, because it was an incestuous child; and
cited Merret and his wife to appear before himself and
his church upon an indictment of incest. Merret appeared;
the verdict was, “Guilty of incest.” He appealed
to the Association, which also found him guilty
of incest. He again appealed to the Consociation, and
was again found guilty of incest. Merret and his wife
were then ordered to separate, and make a public confession,
on pain of excommunication. Merret refused;
whereupon the minister read the act of excommunication,
while the deacons shoved Merret out of the meeting-house.
Being thus cast out of the synagogue, and
debarred from the conversation of any one in the parish,
it was well said by Mr. Merret: “If this be not to
exercise the power of the keys, I know not what it is.”
The poor man soon after died with a broken heart, and
was buried in his own garden by such christian brethren
as were not afraid of the mild puissance of the Consociation.</p>

<p>Mr. Neal says, also, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 609, after evincing his
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
jealousy at the growth of the Church of England in
New-England: “If the religious liberties of the plantations
are invaded by the setting up of spiritual courts,
&amp;c., they will feel the sad effects of it.” In this sentiment
I agree with Mr. Neal; but, unluckily, he meant
the bishops courts, and I meant the courts of synods,
composed of his “meek, exemplary, and learned divines
of New-England,” but who are more severe and terrible
than even was the Star-Chamber under the influence
of Laud, or the Inquisition of Spain. The ecclesiastical
courts of New-England have, in the course of 160 years,
bored the tongues with hot needles, cut off the ears,
branded the foreheads of, and banished, imprisoned,
and hanged more quakers, baptists, adamites, ranters,
episcopalians, for what they call heresy, blasphemy,
and witchcraft, than there are instances of persecution
in Fox’s book of Martyrology, or under the bishops of
England since the death of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> And yet
Mr. Neal was afraid of spiritual courts, and admired
the practice of New-England churches, who only excommunicated
offenders, delivering them over to the
civil magistrates to torture and ruin. If I remember
right, I once saw the Inquisition of Portugal act after
the same manner, when the priest said, “We deal with
the soul, and the civil magistrate with the body.”</p>

<p>Time not having destroyed the walls of the fort
at Saybrook, Mr. Whitefield, in 1740, attempted to
bring them down, as Joshua brought down the walls
of Jericho, to convince the gaping multitude of his
divine mission. He walked several times round the
fort with prayer, and rams’-horns blowing; he called
on the angel of Joshua to come and do as he had done
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
at the walls of Jericho; but the angel was deaf, or on
a journey, or asleep, and therefore the walls remained.
Hereupon George cried aloud: “This town is accursed
for not receiving the messenger of the Lord; therefore
the angel is departed, and the walls shall stand
as a monument of sinful people.” He shook off the
dust of his feet against them, and departed, and went
to Lyme.</p>

<p><span class="location">Killingsworth</span> is ten miles west from Saybrook, lies
on the sea, and resembles Wadsworth. The town is
eight miles square, and divided into two parishes. This
town is noted for the residence of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Elliot,
commonly known as Dr. Elliot, who discovered the art
of making steel out of sand, and wrote a book on husbandry,
which will secure him a place in the Temple of
Fame.</p>

<p><span class="location">Windham</span>, the second county in the ancient kingdom
of Sassacus, or colony of Saybrook, is hilly; but the
soil being rich, has excellent butter, cheese, hemp, Indian-corn,
and horses. Its towns are twelve.</p>

<p>Windham resembles Rumford, and stands on Winnomantic
River. Its meeting-house is elegant, and has
a steeple, bell, and clock. Its court-house is scarcely to
be looked upon as an ornament. The township forms
four parishes, and is ten miles square.</p>

<p>Strangers are very much terrified at the hideous
noise made on summer evenings by the vast number of
frogs in the brooks and ponds. There are about thirty
different voices among them, some of which resemble
the bellowing of a bull. The owls and whippoorwills
complete the rough concert, which may be heard several
miles. Persons accustomed to such serenades are
<!--130.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>
not disturbed by them at their proper stations; but one
night in July, 1758, the frogs of an artificial pond,
three miles square, and about five from Windham,
finding the water dried up, left the place in a body,
and marched, or rather hopped, towards Winnomantic
River. They were under the necessity of taking the
road and going through the town, which they entered
about midnight. The bull-frogs were the leaders, and
the pipers followed without number. They filled the
road, forty yards wide, for four miles in length, and
were for several hours in passing through the town unusually
clamorous.</p>

<p>The inhabitants were equally perplexed and frightened:
some expected to find an army of French and
Indians; others feared an earthquake, and dissolution of
Nature. The consternation was universal. Old and
young, male and female; fled naked from their beds,
with worse shriekings than those of the frogs. The
event was fatal to several women. The men, after a
flight of half a mile, in which they met with many
broken shins, finding no enemies in pursuit of them,
made a hault, and summoned resolution enough to
venture back to their wives and children, when they
distinctly heard from the enemy’s camp these words:
Wight, Hilderkin, Dier, Tete. This last, they thought,
meant treaty, and, plucking up courage, they sent a
triumvirate to capitulate with the supposed French and
Indians. These the men approached in their shirts,
and begged to speak with the general; but, it being
dark and no answer given, they were sorely agitated
for some time betwixt hope and fear: at length, however,
they discovered that the dreaded inimical army
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>
was an army of thirsty frogs going to the river for a
little water.</p>

<p>Such an incursion was never known before nor
since; and yet the people of Windham have been ridiculed
for their timidity on this occasion. I verily believe
an army under the Duke of Marlborough would, under
like circumstances, have acted no better than they
did.</p>

<p>In 1768 the inhabitants of Connecticut River were
as much alarmed by an army of caterpillars as those of
Windham were at the frogs; and no one found reason
to jest at their fears. Those worms came in one night
and covered the earth, on both sides of the river, to an
extent of three miles in front and two in depth. They
marched with great speed, and eat up everything green
for the space of one hundred miles, in spite of rivers,
ditches, fires, and the united efforts of 1,000 men. They
were, in general, two inches long, had white bodies
covered with thorns, and red throats. When they had
finished their work they went down to the river Connecticut,
where they died, poisoning the waters, until they
were washed into the sea. This calamity was imputed
by some to the vast number of logs and trees lying
in the creeks, and to cinders, smoke, and fires, made to
consume the waste wood for three or four hundred
miles up the Connecticut River; while others thought
it augurated future evils, similar to those of Egypt.
The inhabitants of the Verdmonts would unavoidably
have perished with famine, in consequence of the devastation
of these worms, had not a remarkable Providence
filled the wilderness with wild pigeons, which
were killed by sticks as they sat upon the branches of
<!--132.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>
the trees, in such multitudes that 30,000 people lived on
them for three weeks. If a natural cause may be assigned
for the coming of the frogs and caterpillars, yet
the visit of the pigeons to the wilderness in August has
been necessarily ascribed to the interposition of infinite
Power and Goodness. Happy will it be for America,
if the smiling providence of Heaven produces gratitude,
repentance, and obedience, amongst her children!</p>

<p><span class="location">Lebanon</span> lies on the west side of Winnomantic River.
The best street, which has good houses on both sides,
is one mile long and one hundred yards wide. An
elegant meeting-house, with steeple and bell, stands in
the centre. The township is ten miles square, and
forms four parishes. This town was formerly famous
for an Indian school, under the conduct of <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Eleazer
Wheelock, whose great zeal for the spiritual good of
the savages in the wilderness induced him to solicit a
collection from England. Having met with success, his
school at Lebanon became a college in the province of
Newhampshire, where he has converted his godliness
into gain, and promises fair to excuse government from
the expense of a superintendent of Indian affairs.</p>

<p><span class="location">Coventry</span> lies on the same river; the houses are
straggling. The township is ten miles square, and consists
of two parishes. Here are two ponds, the one
three and the other four miles long, and half as wide,
well filled with mackerel and other fish.</p>

<p><span class="location">Mansfield</span> lies east of Coventry, on Winnomantic
and Fundy Rivers; the houses are scattered. The
township is eight miles square, and divided into two
parishes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Union</span> and <span class="location">Wilmington</span> lie on Winnomantic River,
<!--133.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>
forming two parishes. Each township is six miles
square.</p>

<p><span class="location">Ashford</span> lies on the Fundy, in a township ten miles
square, and forms three parishes. The people of the
town have distinguished themselves by a strict enforcement
of the colony-laws against heretics and episcopalians,
for not attending their meeting on the Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="location">Woodstock</span> lies on Quinnibaug, and resembles Finchley.
The township is ten miles square, and divided
into three parishes. Woodstock had the honour of giving
birth to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Bradbury Chandler, D. D., a
learned divine of the Church of England, and well
known in the literary world.</p>

<p><span class="location">Killingsley</span> lies east of Woodstock. The township,
twenty miles long and six wide, forms three parishes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Pomfret</span> stands on Quinnibaug River, and resembles
Battersea. The township is twelve miles square,
and forms four parishes, one of which is episcopal.
Fanaticism had always prevailed in the county of
Windham over christian moderation: where, about the
year 1770, after many abuses, the episcopalians found a
friend in Godfree Malebone, Esq. who built on his own
estate an elegant church, which was patronized by the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts, who appointed a clergyman.</p>

<p>We read that David slew a lion and a bear, and
afterwards that Saul trusted him to fight Goliath. In
Pomfret lives Colonel Israel Putnam, who slew a she-bear
and her two cubs with a billet of wood. The
bravery of this action brought him into public notice;
and it seems he is one of fortune’s favourites. The story
is as follows: In 1754 a large she-bear came in the
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>
night from her den, which was three miles from Mr.
Putnam’s house, and took a sow out of his pen. The
sow, by squeaking, awoke Mr. Putnam, who hastily ran
to the poor creature’s relief; but, before he could reach
the pen, the bear had left it, and was trotting away
with the sow in her mouth. Mr. Putnam took up a
billet of wood and followed the screaming of the sow,
till he came to the foot of the mountain where the den
was. Dauntless he entered the horrid cavern, and,
after walking and crawling on his hands and knees for
fifty yards, came to a roomy cell, where the bear met
him with great fury. He saw nothing but the fire of
her eyes, but that was sufficient for our hero; he accordingly
directed his blow, which at once proved fatal
to the bear, and saved his own life at a most critical
moment. Putnam then discovered and killed the two
cubs; and having, though in Egyptian darkness, dragged
them and the dead sow, one by one, out of the cave,
he went home, and calmly reported to his family what
had happened. The neighbors declared, on viewing
the place by torchlight, that his exploit exceeded those
of Samson or David. Soon after, the General Assembly
appointed Mr. Putnam a lieutenant in the army
marching against Canada. His courage and good conduct
raised him to the rank of Captain the next year.
The third year he was made a Major, and the fourth a
Colonel. Putnam and Rogers were the heroes through
the last war. Putnam was so hardy, at a time when
the Indians had killed all his men and completely
hemmed him in upon a river, as to leap into the stream,
which in a minute carried him down a stupendous falls,
where no tree could pass without being torn to pieces.
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
The Indians reasonably concluded that Putnam, their
terrible enemy, was dead, and made their report accordingly
at Ticonderoga; but soon after a scouting
party found their sad mistake in a bloody rencontre.
Some few that got off declared that Putnam was yet
living, and that he was the first son of Hobbomockow,
and therefore immortal. However, at length the Indians
took this terrible warrior prisoner, and tied him
to a tree, where he hung three days without food or
drink. They did not attempt to kill him, for fear of
offending Hobbomockow; but they sold him to the
French at a great price. The name of Putnam was
more alarming to the Indians than cannon, and they
never would fight him after his escape from the falls.
He was afterwards redeemed by the English.</p>

<p><span class="location">Plainfield</span> and <span class="location">Canterbury</span> lie on Quinnibaug River,
opposite to one another, and have much the appearance
of Lewisham. Each township is eight miles square,
and forms two parishes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Voluntown</span> lies on a small river, and resembles
Finchley Common. The township is fifteen miles
long and five wide, and forms three parishes, one of
which is Presbyterian. This sect has met with as little
christian charity and humanity in this hair-brained
country as the Anabaptists, Quakers, and Churchmen.
The <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> of this town, as they style themselves,
will not attend the funeral of a Presbyterian.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kingdom of Connecticote</span> forms two counties,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Hertford and Litchfield, which contain about 15,000
houses and 120,000 inhabitants. The county of Hertford
excels the rest in tobacco, onions, grain of all sorts,
hay, and cider. It contains twenty-one towns, the chief
<!--136.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>
of which I shall describe, comparing the rest to the
towns near London.</p>

<p><span class="location">Hertford</span> town is deemed the capital of the province;
it stands forty miles from Saybrook, and the same
distance from Newhaven, on the west bank of Connecticut
River, and is formed into squares. The township
is twenty miles from east to west, and six in breadth,
comprising six parishes, one of which is episcopal.</p>

<p>The houses are partly of brick and partly of wood,
well built, but, as I have observed in general of the
towns in Connecticut, do not join. King’s Street is two
miles long and thirty yards wide, well paved, and cut
in two by a small river, over which is a high bridge.
The town is half a mile wide. A grand court-house,
and two elegant meetings, with steeples, bells, and
clocks, adorn it. In 1760 a foundation of quarry-stone
was laid for an Episcopal church in this town, at the
expense of nearly 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, on which occasion the episcopalians
had a mortifying proof that the present inhabitants
inherit the spirit of their ancestors. Samuel Talcott,
Esq. one of the Judges of the County Court, with
the assistance of a mob, took away the stones, and with
them built a house for his son. What added to so meritorious
an action, was its being justified by the General
Assembly and the Consociation. In 1652 this town had
the honour of executing Mrs. Greensmith, the first witch
ever heard of in America. She was accused, in the indictment,
of practising evil things on the body of Ann
Cole, which did not appear to be true; but the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr.
Stone, and other ministers, swore that Greensmith had
confessed to them that the devil had had carnal knowledge
of her. The Court then ordered her to be hanged
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
upon the indictment. Surely none of the learned divines
and statesmen studied in the Temple or Lincoln’s
Inn! It should seem that every Dominion or township
was possessed of an ambition to make itself famous in
history. The same year Springfield, not to be outdone
by Hertford, brought Hugh Parsons to trial for witchcraft,
and the jury found him guilty. Mr. Pincheon, the
Judge, had some understanding, and prevented his execution
till the matter was laid before the General
Court in Boston, who determined that he was not guilty
of witchcraft. The truth was, Parsons was blessed with
a fine person and genteel address, insomuch that the
women could not help admiring him above every other
man in Springfield, and the men could not help hating
him; so that there were witnesses enough to swear that
Parsons was a wizzard, because he made the females
love and the men hate him.</p>

<p>In Hertford are the following curiosities: 1. A
house built of American oak in 1640, the timbers of
which are yet sound, nay, almost petrified; in it was
born John Belcher, Esq. Governor of Massachusets-Bay,
and New-Jersey. 2. An elm, esteemed sacred, for
being the tree in which their Charter was concealed.
3. A wonderful well, which was dug sixty feet deep
without any appearance of water, when a large rock
was met with. The miners, boring this rock in order
to blast it with powder, drove the auger through it,
upon which the water spouted up with such great velocity
that it was with difficulty the well was stoned.
It soon filled and ran over, and has supported, or rather
made, a brook for above one hundred years.</p>

<p>The tomb of Mr. Hooker is viewed with great reverence
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>
by his disciples. Nathaniel, his great-grandson,
a minister in Hertford, inherits more than all his virtues,
without any of his vices.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="location">Weathersfield</span> is four miles from Hertford, and more
compact than any town in the colony. The meeting-house
is of brick, with a steeple, bell, and clock. The
inhabitants say it is much larger than Solomon’s Temple.
The township is ten miles square; parishes four. The
people are more gay than polite, and more superstitious
than religious. This town raises more onions than are
consumed in all New-England. It is a rule with parents
to buy annually a silk gown for each daughter above
seven years old, till she is married. The young beauty
is obliged, in return, to weed a patch of onions with
her own hands; which she performs in the cool of the
morning, before she dresses her beefsteak. This laudable
and healthy custom is ridiculed by the ladies of
other towns, who idle away their mornings in bed, or
in gathering the pink, or catching the butterfly, to ornament
their toilets; while the gentlemen, far and near,
forget not the Weathersfield ladies’ silken industry.</p>

<p>Weathersfield was settled in 1637 by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr.
Smith and his followers, who left Watertown, near Boston,
in order to get out of the power of Mr. Cotton, whose
severity in New-England exceeded that of the bishops
in Old-England. But Mr. Smith did not discard the
spirit of persecution as the sole property of Mr. Cotton,
but carried with him a sufficient quantity of it to distress
and divide his little flock.</p>

<p><span class="location">Middletown</span> is ten miles below Weathersfield, and
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>
beautifully situated upon the Connecticut, between two
small rivers one mile asunder, which is the length of
the town and grand street. Here is an elegant church,
with steeple, bell, clock, and organ; and a large meeting
without a steeple. The people are polite, and not
much troubled with that fanatic zeal which pervades
the rest of the colony. The township is ten miles
square, and forms four parishes, one episcopalian. This
and the two preceding towns may be compared to
Chelsea.</p>

<p>The following towns, which lie on the Connecticut
River, are so much alike that a description of one will
serve for the whole, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <span class="location">Windsor</span>, <span class="location">East Windsor</span>, <span class="location">Glastenbury</span>,
<span class="location">Endfield</span>, <span class="location">Suffield</span>, <span class="location">Chatham</span>, <span class="location">Haddam</span>, and <span class="location">East
Haddam</span>. Windsor, the best, is cut in two by the river
Ett, which wanders from the northward 100 miles,
through various meadows, towns, and villages, and resembles
Bedford. Township ten miles square, forming
three parishes. It was settled in 1637 by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr.
Huet and his associates, who fled from religious slavery
in Boston, to enjoy the power of depriving others of
liberty.</p>

<p>The following towns, lying back of the river towns,
being similar in most respects, I shall join also in one
class, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <span class="location">Hebron</span>, <span class="location">Colchester</span>, <span class="location">Bolton</span>, <span class="location">Tolland</span>, <span class="location">Stafford</span>,
and <span class="location">Sommers</span>.</p>

<p><span class="location">Hebron</span> is the centre of the province, and it is
remarkable that there are thirty-six towns larger and
thirty-six less. It is situated between two ponds,
about two miles in length and one in breadth, and
is intersected by two small rivers, one of which falls
into the Connecticut, the other into the Thames. A
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>
large meeting stands on the square, where four roads
meet. The town resembles Finchley. The township is
eight miles square; five parishes, one is episcopal. The
number of houses is 400; of inhabitants, 3,200. It
pays one part out of seventy-three of the governmental
taxes, and is a bed of farmers on their own estates.
Frequent suits about the Indian titles have rendered
them famous for their knowledge in law and self-preservation.
In 1740 Mr. George Whitefield gave them
this laconic character: “Hebron,” says he, “is the
stronghold of Satan; for its people mightily oppose
the work of the Lord, being more fond of earth than
heaven.” This town is honoured by the residence of the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Benjamin Pomeroy, an excellent scholar, an
exemplary gentleman, and a most thundering preacher
of the New-Light order. His great abilities procured
him the favour and honour of being the instructor of
Abimeleck, the present king of Mohegin. He is of a
very persevering, sovereign disposition, but just, polite,
generous, charitable, and without dissimulation. <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Avis
alba.</span> Here also reside some of the descendants of
William Peters, Esq. already spoken of, among whom
is the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
an episcopal clergyman,
who, by his generosity and zeal for the Church of England,
rendered himself famous both in New and Old-England,
<!--141.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>
and in some degree made an atonement for
the fanaticism and treason of his uncle Hugh, and of his
ancestor on his mother’s side, Major-General Thomas
Harrison, both hanged at Charing-Cross in the last
century.</p>

<p><span class="location">Colchester</span> has to boast of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Buckley
for its first minister, whose grandfather was the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Peter Buckley, of Woodhill, in Bedfordshire in Old-England;
who, after being silenced by the bishop for
his misconduct, went to New-England in 1635, and
died at Concord in 1658.</p>

<p>John Buckley was a great scholar, and, suffering
prudence to govern his hard temper, he conciliated the
esteem of all parties, and became the ornament of the
<span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> in Connecticut. He was a lawyer,
a physician, and divine. He published an ingenious
pamphlet to prove that the title of the people to their
lands was good, because they had taken them out of the
state of nature. His argument satisfied many who
thought their titles were neither legal, just, nor scriptural;
indeed, it may seem conclusive, if his major proposition
be granted, that the English found Connecticut
in a state of nature. His son John was a lawyer and
physician of great reputation, and was appointed a
Judge of the Superior Court very young. He and his
father were suspected to be not sound in faith, because
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>
they used in their prayers, “From battle and murder,
and from sudden death, good Lord deliver us, for the
sake of thine only Son, who commands us thus to pray,
Our Father,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Peter Buckley was possessed
of a gentleman’s estate in Bedfordshire, which he sold,
and spent the produce among his servants in Massachusets-Bay.
His posterity in Colchester, in Connecticut,
are very rich, and, till lately, were held in great esteem,
which, however, they lost by conforming to the Church
of England.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable to be observed of any
of the other towns I have classed with Hebron, except
<span class="location">Stafford</span>, which possesses a mineral spring that has the
reputation of curing the gout, sterility, pulmony, hysterics,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and therefore is the New-England
“Bath,” where the sick and rich resort to prolong life
and acquire the polite accomplishments.</p>

<p><span class="location">Herrington</span>, <span class="location">Farmington</span>, and <span class="location">Symsbury</span>, lying on
the west of Hertford, and on the river Ett, will finish
the county of Hertford.</p>

<p><span class="location">Herrington</span> is ten miles square, and forms two parishes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Farmington</span> resembles Corydon. The township is
fifteen miles square, and forms eight parishes, three of
which are episcopal. Here the meadow-land is sold at
50<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per acre.</p>

<p><span class="location">Symsbury</span>, with its meadows and surrounding hills,
forms a beautiful landscape, much like Maidstone, in
Kent. The township is twenty miles square, and consists
of nine parishes, four of which are episcopal.
Here are copper mines. In working one, many years
ago, the miners bored half a mile through a mountain,
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
making large cells, forty yards below the surface, which
now serve as a prison, by order of the General Assembly,
for such offenders as they choose not to hang. The
prisoners are let down on a windlass into this dismal
cavern, through a hole which answers the triple purpose
of conveying them food, air, and—I was going to say—light,
but that scarcely reaches them. In a few months
the prisoners are released by death, and the colony rejoices
in her great humanity and the mildness of her
laws. This conclave of spirits imprisoned may be called
with great propriety the Catacomb of Connecticut. The
light of the sun and the light of the Gospel are alike
shut out from the martyrs, whose resurrection-state will
eclipse the wonder of that of Lazarus. It has been remarked
by the candid part of this religious colony, that
the General Assembly and Consociation have never allowed
any prisoners in the whole province a chaplain,
though they have spent much of their time and public
money in spreading the gospel in the neighbouring colonies
among the Indians, Quakers, and episcopalians,
and though, at the same time, those religionists preach
damnation to all people who neglect to attend public
worship twice every Sabbath, fasting, and thanksgiving
days, provided they are appointed by themselves,
and not by the King and Parliament of Great Britain.
This well-founded remark has been treated by the
zealots as springing more from malice than policy.</p>

<p>I beg leave to give the following instances of the
humanity and mildness the province has always manifested
for the episcopal clergy.</p>

<p>About 1746, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Gibbs, of Symsbury, refusing
to pay a rate imposed for the salary of Mr. Mills,
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>
a dissenting minister in the same town, was, by the collector,
thrown across a horse, lashed hands and feet
under the creature’s belly, and carried many miles in
that humane manner to gaol. Mr. Gibbs was half dead
when he got there; and though he was released by his
church wardens, who, to save his life, paid the assessment,
yet, having taken cold in addition to his bruises,
he became delirious, and has remained in a state of insanity
ever since.</p>

<p>In 1772 the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Moyley, a missionary from the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, at Litchfield,
was presented by the Grand Jury for marrying a couple
belonging to his parish, after the banns had been duly
published, and consent of parents obtained. The Court
mildly fined Mr. Moyley 20<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> because he could not show
any other license to officiate as a clergyman than what
he had received from the Bishop of London, whose
authority the Court determined did not extend to Connecticut,
which was a chartered government. One of
the Judges said: “It is high time to put a stop to the
usurpations of the Bishop of London, and to let him
know that, though his license be lawful, and may empower
one of his curates to marry in England, yet it
is not so in America; and if fines would not curb
them in this point, imprisonment should.”</p>

<p>The second county in the Kingdom of Connecticote,
and the most mountainous in the whole province, is
<span class="location">Litchfield</span>, which produces abundance of wheat, butter,
cheese, iron ore, &amp;c., and has many iron works, foundries,
and furnaces. It contains the following fourteen
towns:</p>

<p><span class="location">Litchfield</span> is watered by two small rivers. An elegant
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>
meeting-house and decent court-house, with steeple
and bells, ornament the square, where three roads meet.
The best street is one mile long. It resembles Dartford.
The township is twelve miles square, and forms
five parishes, one of which is episcopal.</p>

<p>Though Litchfield is the youngest county of Connecticut,
yet in 1766 it set an example to the rest worthy of
imitation. The province had always been greatly pestered
by a generation of men called “quacks,” who, with a few
Indian nostrums, a lancet, a glister-pipe, rhubarb, treacle-water
mixed with Roman bombast of <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vena cava</span> and
<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vena porta</span>, attacked fevers, nervous disorders, and
broken bones, and, by the grace of perseverance, subdued
Nature, and helped their patients to a passage to the
world of spirits before they were ready. The surgeons
and physicians who were not quacks formed themselves
into a society for the encouragement of literature and
a regular and wholesome practice. But their laudable
endeavours were discountenanced by the General Assembly,
who refused to comply with their solicitations
for a charter; because the quacks and the people said,
“If the charter were granted, the learned men would
become too rich by an monopoly, as they did in England.”
The answer to this question was, “Would it
not be better to permit a monopoly to preserve the
health and lives of the people, than to suffer quacks
to kill them and ruin the province?” The reply
proved decisive in that fanatical Assembly, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “No
medicine can be serviceable without the blessing of
God. The quacks never administer any physic without
the prayers of the minister.” One doctor proposed
the trial of a dose of arsenic—whether it would
<!--146.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
not kill any one who would take it, though twenty
ministers should pray against it. He was called a profane
man, the petition was rejected, and quackery remains
triumphant.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
</p>

<p><span class="location">New-Milford</span> lies on the Osootonoc River. A church
and meeting, with steeples and bells, beautify the town,
which resembles Fulham. The township, twelve miles
square, forms five parishes, of which two are episcopal.</p>

<p><span class="location">Woodbury</span> lies on the same river, and resembles
Kentish-town. The township, twelve miles square, is
divided into seven parishes, three of them episcopal.
In this town lives the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Bellamy, who is a good
scholar and a great preacher. He has attempted to
shew a more excellent way to heaven than was known
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>
before. He may be called the Athenian of Connecticut,
for he has published something new to the christian
world. Zuinglius may learn from him.</p>

<p>The following towns lie also on the Osootonoc,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <span class="location">Sharon</span>, <span class="location">Kent</span>, <span class="location">Salisbury</span>, <span class="location">New Fairfield</span>, <span class="location">Cornwall</span>,
<span class="location">Goshen</span>, and <span class="location">Canaan</span>; and all of them resemble Finchley.
Each township is ten miles square.</p>

<p><span class="location">Sharon</span> forms three parishes, one of which is episcopal.
It is much noted on account of a famous mill, invented
and built by a Mr. Joel Harvey upon his own
estate; for which he received a compliment of 20<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
from the Society of Arts in London. The water, by
turning one wheel, sets the whole in motion. In two
apartments wheat is ground; in two others, bolted; in
another, thrashed; in a sixth, winnowed; in the seventh,
hemp and flax are beaten; and in the eighth, dressed.
Either branch is discontinued at pleasure, without impeding
the rest.</p>

<p>The other towns of Litchfield county are: <span class="location">New-Hertford</span>,
<span class="location">Torrington</span>, <span class="location">Hartland</span>, and <span class="location">Winchester</span>; all
which lie on the river Ett. The townships are severally
about six miles square, and each forms one parish.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Kingdom of Quinnipiog</span> constituted the Dominion
of Newhaven, divided into two counties, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
Newhaven and Fairfield; these again divided into
seventeen townships, about twelve miles square each.
The number of houses is nearly 10,000, and that of the
inhabitants 60,000.</p>

<p>The county of <span class="location">Newhaven</span> is hilly, and has a thin
soil, enriched, however, by the industry of its inhabitants.
The chief commodities are flax, rye, barley, white
beans, and salt hay. It contains eight towns, four of
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>
which lie on the Sound, and the others on the back of
them. Newhaven township comprises fourteen parishes,
three of them episcopal and one Sandemanian. The
town, being the most beautiful in New-England, if not
in all America, is entitled to a minute description. It
is bounded southly by the bay, into which the river
Quinnipiack empties itself; easterly and westerly by
two creeks two miles asunder; and northerly by a
lofty mountain, that extends even to the river <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence,
and forms a highland between the rivers Hudson
and Connecticut, standing in a plain three miles by two
in extent. This plain is divided into 300 squares of the
size of Bloomsbury Square, with streets twenty yards
wide between each division. Forty of these squares
are already built upon, having houses of brick and
wood on each front, about five yards asunder; every
house with a garden that produces vegetables sufficient
for the family. Two hundred houses are annually
erected. Elms and button-trees surround the centre
square, wherein are two meetings, the court-house, the
gaol, and Latin school; in the fronts of the adjoining
squares are Yale College, the chapel, a meeting, and a
church: all these grand buildings with steeples and
bells. The market is plentifully supplied with every
necessary during the whole year, excepting greens in
winter. But the harbour is incommoded by flats near
the town for one mile in width, and by ice in winter.
The former evil is, in some measure, remedied by long
and expensive wharves, but the latter is incurable.
The people, however, say their trade is greater than
that of Norwich or New-London; and their shipping,
of different burthens, consists of nearly 200 sail.</p>

<p><!--149.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>
According to Dr. Mather, Newhaven was, about
1646, to have been made a city, the interests of the
colony with Cromwell’s party being then very great;
but a wonderful phenomenon prevented it. As the
good Dr. Mather never wanted faith through the whole
course of his “Magnalia,” and as the New-Englanders
to the present time believe his reports, I will here present
my readers with the history of this miracle:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The people of Newhaven fitted out a ship, and sent her
richly laden for England, to procure a patent for the colony and
a charter for the city. After the ship had been at sea some
weeks, there happened in New-England a violent storm, which
induced the people of Newhaven to fast and pray, to inquire of
the Lord whether their ship was in that storm or not. This
was a real fast: for the people neither eat nor drank from sunrise
to sunset. At five o’clock in the afternoon they came out of
the meeting, walking softly, heavily, and sadly, homewards. On
a sudden the air thundered and the lightnings shone abroad.
They looked up towards the heavens, when they beheld their
ship in full sail, and the sailors steering her from West to East.
She came over the meeting, where they had fasted and prayed,
and there was met by a euroclydon, which rent the sails and
overset the ship. In a few moments she fell down near the
weathercock, on the steeple, and instantly vanished. The people
all returned to the meeting, when the minister gave thanks
to God for answering the desires of his servants, and for giving
them an infallible token of the loss of their ship and charter.”</p>

<p>This, and divers other miracles which have happened
in New-England, have been and still are useful to the
clergy in establishing the people in the belief that there
is a great familiarity between God and their ministers.
Hence the ministers govern the superstitious; whilst
the deacon, the lawyer, and the merchant, for lucre,
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
wink at the imposition. Yet the ministers, in their
turn, are governed by their abettors.</p>

<p>Thou genius of adventure, that carriedst Columbus
from eastern to western shores, the domain of savage
beasts and savage men, now cursed with the demons of
superstition and fanaticism, oh, kindle in no other
breast the wish to seek new worlds! Africa already
mourns, and Europe trembles!</p>

<p>The true character of Davenport and Eaton, the
leaders of the first settlers of Newhaven, may be
learnt from the following fact: An English gentleman
of the name of Grigson, coming on his travels to Newhaven
about the year 1644, was greatly pleased with
its pleasant situation, and, after purchasing a large settlement,
sent to London for his wife and family. But,
before their arrival, he found that a charming situation,
without the blessings of religious and civil liberty, would
not render him and his family happy; he resolved, therefore,
to quit the country and return to England as soon
as his family should arrive, and accordingly advertised
his property for sale; when, lo! agreeable to one of
the Bible laws, no one would buy, because he had not,
and could not obtain, liberty of the selectmen to sell it.
The patriotic virtue of the selectmen thus becoming an
insurmountable bar to the sale of his Newhaven estate,
Mr. Grigson made his will, and bequeathed part of his
lands towards the support of an episcopal clergyman,
who should reside in that town, and the residue to his
own heirs. Having deposited his will in the hands of
a friend, he set sail with his family for England, but
died on the passage. This friend proved the will, and
had it recorded, but died also soon after. The record
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
was dexterously concealed, by glueing two leaves together;
and, after some years, the selectmen sold the
whole estate to pay taxes, though the rent of Mr. Grigson’s
house alone, in one year, would pay taxes for ten.
Some persons hardy enough to exclaim against this
glaring act of injustice, were soon silenced and expelled
the town. In 1750 an episcopal clergyman was settled
in Newhaven, and, having been informed of Grigson’s
will, applied to the town clerk for a copy, who
told him there was no such will on record, and withal
refused him the liberty of searching. In 1768, Peter
Harrison, Esq. of Nottinghamshire in England, the
king’s collector in Newhaven, claimed his right of
searching public records; and, being a stranger, and
not supposed to have any knowledge of Grigson’s will,
obtained his demand. The alphabet contained Grigson’s
name, and referred to a page which was not to be
found in the book. Mr. Harrison supposed it to have
been torn out; but, on closer examination, discovered
one leaf much thicker than the others. He put a corner
of the thick leaf in his mouth, and soon found it
was composed of two leaves, which with much difficulty
having separated, he found Grigson’s will! To make
sure of the work, he took a copy of it himself, and then
called the clerk to draw and attest another, which was
done. Thus furnished, Mr. Harrison instantly applied
to the selectmen, and demanded a surrender of the
land which belonged to the Church, but which they as
promptly refused; whereupon Mr. Harrison took out
writs of ejectment against the possessors. As might
be expected, Mr. Harrison, from a good man, became,
in ten days, the worst man in the world; but, being a
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
generous and brave Englishman, he valued not their
clamors and curses, though they terrified the gentlemen
of the law. Harrison was obliged to be his own lawyer,
and boldly declared he expected to lose his cause
in New-England; but after that he would appeal, and
try it, at his own expense, in Old-England, where justice
reigned. The good people, knowing Harrison did not
get his bread by their votes, and that they could not
baffle him, resigned the lands to the Church on that
gentleman’s own terms, which in a few years will support
a clergyman in a very genteel manner. The honest
selectmen yet possess the other lands, though report
says Mr. Grigson has an heir of his own name residing
near Holborn, in London, who inherits the virtues of
his ancestor, and ought to inherit his estate.</p>

<p>The sad and awful discovery of Mr. Grigson’s will,
after having been concealed for one hundred years,
would have confounded any people but those of Newhaven,
who study nothing but religion and liberty.
Those pious souls consoled themselves by comparison:
“We are no worse,” said they, “than the people of
Boston and Windham County.” The following will
explain this justification of the saints of Newhaven:</p>

<p>In 1740 Mrs. Cursette, an English lady, travelling
from New-York to Boston, was obliged to stay some
days at Hebron; when, seeing the church not finished,
and the people suffering great persecutions, she told
them to persevere in their good work, and she would
send them a present when she got to Boston. Soon
after her arrival there Mrs. Cursette fell sick and died.
In her will she gave a legacy of 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> old tenor (then
equal to 100<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> sterling) to the Church of England in
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>
Hebron, and appointed John Handcock, Esq. and
Nathaniel Glover, her executors. Glover was also her
residuary legatee. The will was obliged to be recorded
in Windham County, because some of Mrs. Cursette’s
lands lay there. Glover sent the will to Deacon S. H—&#8203;—,
of Canterbury, ordering him to get it recorded, and
keep it private, lest the legacy should build up the
Church. The Deacon and Registrar were faithful to
their trust, and kept Glover’s secret twenty-five years.
At length the Deacon was taken ill, and his life was
supposed in great danger. Among his penitential confessions,
he told of his having concealed Mrs. Cursette’s
will. His confidant went to Hebron, and informed
the wardens that for one guinea he would discover a
secret of 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> old tenor consequence to the Church.
The guinea was paid and the secret disclosed. A demand
of the legacy ensued. Mr. Handcock referred
to Glover, and Glover said he was neither obliged to
publish the will nor pay the legacy: it had lapsed to
the heir-at-law. It being difficult for a Connecticut
man to recover a debt in the Massachusets-Bay, and
<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span>, the wardens were obliged to accept from
Mr. Glover 30<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> instead of 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> sterling; which sum,
allowing 200<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> as lawful simple interest at six per cent.
for twenty-five years, ought in equity have been paid.
This matter, however, Mr. Glover is to settle with Mrs.
Cursette in the other world.</p>

<p>Newhaven is celebrated for having given the name
of “pumpkin-heads” to all the New-Englanders. It
originated from the “Blue Laws,” which enjoined every
male to have his hair cut round by a cap. When caps
were not to be had, they substituted the hard shell of a
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>
pumpkin, which being put on the head every Saturday,
the hair is cut by the shell all round the head. Whatever
religious virtue is supposed to be derived from
this custom, I know not; but there is much prudence
in it: first, it prevents the hair from snarling; secondly,
it saves the use of combs, bags, and ribbons; thirdly,
the hair cannot incommode the eyes by falling over
them; and fourthly, such persons as have lost their
ears for heresy, and other wickedness, cannot conceal
their misfortune and disgrace.</p>

<p>Cruelty and godliness were perhaps never so well
reconciled by any people as by those of Newhaven,
who are alike renounded for both. The unhappy story
of Deacon Potter has eternalized the infamy of their
Blue Laws, and almost annexed to their town the name
of Sodom. The Deacon had borne the best of characters
many years; he was the peacemaker, and an enemy
to persecution; but he was grown old, was rich, and had
a young wife. His young wife had an inclination for
a young husband, and had waited with impatience for
the death of her old one, till at length, resolving, if
possible, to accelerate the attainment of her wishes, she
complained to the magistrate that her husband did not
render her due benevolence. The Judge took no notice
of what she said. She then swore that her husband
was an apostate, and that he was fonder of his mare,
bitch, and cow, than of her; in which allegation she
was joined by her son. The Deacon was brought to
trial, condemned, and executed with the beasts, and
with them also buried in one common grave. Dr.
Mather, with his usual quantity of faith, speaks of the
Deacon as very guilty, as having had a fair, legal, and
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>
candid trial, and convicted on good and scriptural evidence.
I am willing to allow the Doctor as much sincerity
as faith. He had his information from the party
who condemned the Deacon; but there are manuscripts,
which I have seen, that state the matter thus: Deacon
Potter was hanged for heresy and apostacy, which consisted
in showing hospitality to strangers, who came to
his house in the night, among whom were Quakers,
Anabaptists, and Adamites. This was forbidden by
the Blue Laws, which punished for the first and second
offence with fines, and with death for the third. His
wife and son betrayed him for hiding the spies and
sending them away in peace. The Court was contented
with calling his complicated crimes beastiality; his
widow with a new husband; and the son with the
estate; while the public were deceived by the arts of
the wicked junto.</p>

<p>I have related this story to shew the danger of admitting
a wife to give evidence against her husband,
according to the Blue Laws; and to caution all readers
against crediting too much the historians of New-England,
who, either from motives of fear or emolument,
have in numberless instances designedly disguised or
concealed the truth. Such persons whose stubborn
principles would not bend to this yoke, were not suffered
to search the colonial records; and those who
have dared to intimate that all was not right among
the first settlers, have been compelled to leave the
country with the double loss of character and property.</p>

<p>To Newhaven now belongs Yale College, of which
I have promised my readers a particular account. It
was originally, as already mentioned, a School, established
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Peters at Saybrook, who
left it his library at his death. It soon acquired the
distinguished appellation of “Schola Illustris,” and
about 1700 was honoured by the General Assembly with
a charter of incorporation, converting it into a college,
under the denomination of Yale College, in compliment
to a gentleman of that name, governor of one of the
West India Islands, and its greatest benefactor. The
charter constitutes a president, three tutors, twelve
overseers, and a treasurer; and exempts it from any
visitation of the Governor or Assembly, in order to
secure it against the control of a King’s Governor, in
case one should ever be appointed. I have already observed
that a power of conferring Bachelors’ and Masters’
degrees was granted by the charter, and that the
corporation have thought proper to assume that of conferring
Doctors’ degrees. By the economical regulations
of the College, there are a professor of divinity,
mathematics, and natural philosophy; and four classes
of students, which were at first attended by the president
and the three tutors; but the president has long
been excused that laborious task, and a fourth tutor
appointed in his stead. Each class has its proper tutor.
Once a week the president examines them all in the
public hall, superintends their disputations and scientific
demonstrations, and, if any student appears to be negligent,
orders him under the care of a special tutor—a
stigma which seldom fails of producing its intended
effect. Greek, Latin, geography, history, and logic,
are well taught in this seminary; but it suffers for
want of tutors to teach the Hebrew, French, and Spanish
languages. Oratory, music, and politeness, are equally
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
neglected here and in the colony. The students attend
prayers every morning and evening, at six o’clock.
The president, professor, and one of the tutors, reads
and expounds a chapter, then a psalm is sung, after
which follows a prayer. The hours of study are notified
by the College bell, and every scholar seen out of
his room is liable to a fine, which is seldom excused.
The amusements for the evenings are not cards, dancing,
or music, but reading and composition. They are allowed
two hours’ play with foot-ball every day. Thus
cooped up for four years, they understand books better
than men or manners. They then are admitted to their
Bachelor’s degree, having undergone a public examination
in the arts and sciences. Three years afterwards
they are admitted to their Master’s degree, provided
they have supported moral characters. The ceremony
used by the president upon these occasions is to deliver
a book to the intended Master in Arts, saying: “Admitto
te ad secundum Gradum in Artibus, pro more
Acadæmiarum in Anglia; tradoque tibi hunc librum,
una cum protestate publici prælegendi quoties cunque
ad hoc munus evocatus fueris.” For Bachelors the
same, mutatis mutandis. A diploma in vellum, with the
seal of the College, is given to each Master, and signed
by the president and six fellows or overseers. The first
degrees of Masters were given in 1702. The students
in late years have amounted to about 180. They dine
in the common hall at four tables, and the tutors and
graduates at a fifth. The number of the whole is about
200.</p>

<p>Yale College is built with wood, and painted a sky
colour; it is 160 feet long and three stories high, besides
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>
garrets. In 1754, another building of brick, 100 feet
long and three stories high, exclusive of garrets, with
double rooms, and a double front, was added, and called
Connecticut Hall. About 1760, a very elegant chapel
and library was erected, with brick, under one roof.
But it cannot be supposed the latter is to be compared
with the Vatican or the Bodleian. It consists of eight
or ten thousand volumes in all branches of literature,
but wants modern books; though there is a tolerable
sufficiency, if the corporation would permit what they
call Bishops’ and Arminian books to be read. Ames’
Medulla is allowed, while Grotius de Veritate Religionis
is denied. It was lately presented with a new and
valuable apparatus for experimental philosophy. The
whole library and apparatus was given by various persons,
chiefly English.</p>

<p>The General Assembly have endowed this College
with large tracts of land, which, duly cultivated, will
soon support the ample establishment of an university;
but, even at present, I may truly say, Yale College exceeds
the number, and perhaps the learning, of its
scholars all over British America. This seminary was
in 1717 removed from Saybrook to Newhaven; the extraordinary
cause of its transition I shall here lay before
the reader.</p>

<p>Saybrook Dominion had been settled by Puritans of
some moderation and decency. They had not joined
with Massachusets-Bay, Hertford, and Newhaven, in
sending home agents to assist in the murder of Charles
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and the subversion of the Lords and Bishops; they
had received Hooker’s heretics, and sheltered the apostate
from Davenport’s millenarian system; they had
<!--159.png--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>
shewn an inclination to be dependent on the Mother
Country, and had not wholly anathematized the Church
of England. In short, the people of Hertford and Newhaven
suspected that Saybrook was not truly protestant;
that it had a passion for the leeks and onions of Egypt;
and that the youth belonging to them in the “Schola
Illustris” were in great danger of imbibing its lukewarmness.</p>

<p>A vote therefore passed at Hertford, to remove the
College to Weathersfield, where the leeks and onions of
Egypt would not be thought of; and another at Newhaven,
that it should be removed to that town, where
Christ had established his dominion from sea to sea,
and where he was to begin his millenarian reign.
About 1715 Hertford, in order to carry its vote into
execution, prepared teams, boats, and a mob, and privately
set off for Saybrook, and seized upon the College
apparatus, library, and students, and carried all to
Weathersfield. This redoubled the jealousy of the
saints at Newhaven, who thereupon determined to fulfil
their vote; and, accordingly, having collected a mob
sufficient for the enterprise, they sat out for Weathersfield,
where they seized by surprise the students, library,
&amp;c. &amp;c. But, on the road to Newhaven, they were
overtaken by the Hertford mob, who, however, after an
unhappy battle, were obliged to retire with only a part
of the library and part of the students. Hence sprung
two colleges out of one. The quarrel increased daily,
everybody expecting a war more bloody than that of
Sassacus; and no doubt such would have been the case,
had not the peacemakers of Massachusets-Bay interposed
with their usual friendship, and advised their dear
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>
friends of Hertford to give up the College to Newhaven.
This was accordingly done in 1717, to the great
joy of the crafty Massachusets, who always greedily
seek their own prosperity, though it ruin their best
neighbours.</p>

<p>The College being thus fixed forty miles further west
from Boston than it was before, tended greatly to the
interest of Harvard College; for Saybrook and Hertford,
out of pure grief, sent their sons to Harvard, instead
of the College at Newhaven. This quarrel continued
until 1764, when it subsided into a grand continental
consociation of ministers, which met at Newhaven
to consult the spiritual good of the Mohawks
and other Indian tribes, the best method of preserving
the American Vine, and the protestant, independent
liberty of America: a good preparatory to the rebellion
against Great Britain.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Naphtali Dagget is the fourth president
of Yale College since its removal to Newhaven.
He is an excellent Greek and Latin scholar, and reckoned
a good Calvinistic divine. Though a stranger to
European politeness, yet possessing a mild temper and
affable disposition, the exercise of his authority is untinctured
with haughtiness. Indeed, he seems to have
too much candour and too little bigotry to please the
corporation and retain his post many years. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mr. Nehemiah Strong, the College professor, is also of
an amiable temper, and merits the appointment.</p>

<p>Were the corporation less rigid, and more inclined
to tolerate some reasonable amusements and polite accomplishments
among the youth, they would greatly
add to the fame and increase of the College, and the
<!--161.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
students would not be known by every stranger to have
been educated in Connecticut. The disadvantage under
which they at present appear, from the want of address,
is much to be regretted.</p>

<p><span class="location">Beauford</span>, <span class="location">Guilford</span>, and <span class="location">Milford</span>, are much alike.</p>

<p><span class="location">Guilford</span> is laid out in squares, after the manner of
Newhaven, twenty of which are built upon. The church
and two meetings stand in the centre square. One of
the meetings is very grand, with a steeple, bell, and
clock. The parishes in it are eight, three of them episcopal.</p>

<p>This town gave birth to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Johnson,
D. D., who was the first episcopal minister in Connecticut,
and the first president of King’s College in New-York.
He was educated and became a tutor in the College
at Saybrook, was an ornament to his native country,
and much esteemed for his humanity and learning.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. George Whitefield, in a sermon he
preached in the great meeting, gave the character of the
people of Guilford in 1740. His text was, “Anoint
mine eyes with eye-salve.” After pointing out what
was not the true eye-salve, he said: “I will tell you
what is the true eye-salve: it is faith, it is grace, it
is simplicity, it is virtue. Ah, Lord! where can they
be found! Perhaps not in this grand assembly.”</p>

<p>I have frequently quoted the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George Whitefield,
without that ludicrous intention which, possibly,
the reader may suspect me of. I admire his general
character, his good discernment, his knowledge of mankind,
his piety, his goodness of heart, his generosity,
and hatred of persecution, though I think his zeal was
sometimes too fervent. I ever viewed him as an instrument
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>
of Heaven, as the greatest Boanerges and blessing
America ever knew. He turned the profligate to God;
he roused the lukewarm christian; he tamed the wild
fanatic, and made Felix tremble.</p>

<p>It is true, he has also made wise men mad; but this
is the natural effect of the word, which is the savour of
life and the savour of death at one and the same time.
New-England before his coming was but the slaughter-house
of heretics. He was admired by the oppressed
episcopalians, the trembling Quakers, the bleeding Baptists,
&amp;c., &amp;c. He was followed by all sects and parties,
except the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, who thought their craft
in danger. He made peace where was no peace, and
even his enemies praised him in the gate. Whitefield
did what could not have been done without the aid of
an Omnipotent arm: he planted charity in New-England,
of which the increase has been a thousand-fold.
He is lauded where the wicked cease from troubling;
where his works of faith, love, and charity, clothe him;
and where the glory of eternity blesses him with a welcome
ineffably transporting. May his virtues be imitated,
his imperfections forgiven, and his happiness
obtained by all!</p>

<p><span class="location">Wallingford</span>, <span class="location">Durham</span>, <span class="location">Waterbury</span>, and <span class="location">Derby</span>, finish
the County of Newhaven. <span class="location">Wallingford</span> is the best
of the four: it lies on the Quinnipiack River, and forms
eight parishes, two of which are episcopal. The town
street is one mile long, and the houses stand pretty
thick on both sides. The church and two meetings,
one with a steeple, bell, and clock, stand in the middle
of the street. The grave-stones point out the characters
of the first settlers. An extract from one follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--163.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>
“Here lies the body of Corporal Moses Atwater, who left
England in 1660, to enjoy the liberty of conscience in a howling
wilderness.”</p>

<p>The second county in the Kingdom of Quinnipiog
is <span class="location">Fairfield</span>. It is situated west of Osootonoc River,
and contains nine townships, five of which lie on the
sea, and resemble one another; and on the back of them
are situated four others, which also have a mutual resemblance.
The soil is rich and uneven; the chief productions,
excellent wheat, salt hay, and flax. Those
townships which lie out on the sea are <span class="location">Fairfield</span>, <span class="location">Norwalk</span>,
<span class="location">Stamford</span>, <span class="location">Greenwich</span>, and <span class="location">Stratford</span>. This last
I shall describe.</p>

<p><span class="location">Stratford</span> lies on the west bank of the Osootonoc
River, having the sea, or Sound, on the south; there
are three streets running north and south, and ten east
and west. The best is one mile long. On the centre
square stands a meeting, with steeple and bell, and a
church, with a steeple, bell, clock, and organ. It is a
beautiful place, and from the water has an appearance
not inferior to Canterbury. Of six parishes contained
in it, three are episcopal. The people are said to be the
most polite of any in the colony, owing to the singular
moderation of the town in admitting latterly Europeans
to settle among them. Many persons come also from
the Islands and southern provinces for the benefit of
their health. Here was erected the first episcopal church
in Connecticut. A very extraordinary story is told concerning
the occasion of it, which I shall give the reader
the particulars of, the people being as sanguine in their
belief of it as they are of the ship’s sailing over Newhaven.</p>

<p><!--164.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
An ancient religious rite called the Powwow was
annually celebrated by the Indians, and commonly
lasted several hours every night for two or three weeks.
About 1690 they convened to perform it on Stratford
Point, near the town. During the nocturnal ceremony,
the English saw, or imagined they saw, devils rise out
of the sea, wrapped up in sheets of flame, and flying
round the Indian camp, while the Indians were screaming,
cutting, and prostrating themselves before their
supposed fiery gods. In the midst of the tumult,
the devils darted in among them, seized several and
mounted with them in the air, the cries and groans
issuing from whom quieted the rest. In the morning,
the limbs of Indians, all shrivelled and covered with
sulphur, were found in different parts of the town.
Astonished and terrified at these spectacles, the people
of Stratford began to think the devils would take up
their abode among them, and called together all the
ministers in the neighbourhood to exorcise and lay them.
The ministers began and carried on their warfare with
prayer, hymns, and abjurations; but the powwows continued,
and the devils would not obey. The inhabitants
were about to quit the town, when Mr. Nell spoke and
said, “I would to God Mr. Visey, the episcopal minister
at New-York, was here; for he would expel those evil
spirits.” They laughed at his advice; but on his reminding
them of the little maid who directed Naaman
to cure his leprosy, they voted him their permission to
bring Mr. Visey at the next powwow. Mr. Visey
attended accordingly; and as the powwow commenced
with howling and whoops, Mr. Visey read portions of
the holy scriptures, litany, &amp;c. The sea was put into
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
great commotion; the powwow stopped; the Indians
dispersed, and nevermore held a powwow in Stratford.
The inhabitants were struck with wonder at this
event, and held a conference to discover the reason
why the devils and the powwowers had obeyed the
prayers of one minister, and had paid no regard to
those of fifty. Some thought the reading of the holy
scriptures, others thought that the litany and Lord’s
prayer, some again that the episcopal power of the minister,
and others that all united, were the means of obtaining
the heavenly blessing they had received.</p>

<p>Those that believed that the holy scriptures and litany
were effectual against the devil and his legions, declared
for the Church of England; while the majority ascribed
their deliverance to complot between the devils and the
episcopal minister, with a view to overthrow Christ’s
vine planted in New-England. Each party acted with
more zeal than prudence. The Church, however, increased,
though oppressed by more persecutions and
calamities than were ever experienced by puritans from
bishops and powwowers. Even the use of the Bible,
the Lord’s prayer, the litany, or any part of the prayer-book
was forbidden; nay, ministers taught from their
pulpits, according to the Blue Laws, “that the lovers of
Zion had better put their ears to the mouth of hell and
learn from the whispers of the devil, than read the
bishops’ books;” while the Churchmen, like Michael
the archangel contending with the devil about the body
of Moses, dared not bring against them a railing accusation.
But this was not all. When the episcopalians had
collected timber for a church, they found the devils had
not left town, but only changed their habitation—had
<!--166.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
left the savages, and entered into fanatics and wood. In
the night before the church was to be begun, the
timber set up a country-dance, skipping about and flying
in the air with as much agility and sulphurous
stench as ever the devils had exhibited around the camp
of the Indian powwowers. This alarming circumstance
would have ruined the credit of the Church, had not the
episcopalians ventured to look into the phenomena, and
found the timber had been bored with augers, charged
with gunpowder, and fired off by matches—a discovery,
however, of bad consequence in one respect: it prevented
the annalists of New-England from publishing
this among the rest of their miracles. About
1720, the patience and sufferings of the episcopalians,
who were then but a handful, procured them some
friends even among their persecutors; and those friends
condemned the cruelty exercised over the Churchmen,
Quakers, and Anabaptists, in consequence of which
they first felt the effects of those gentle weapons, the
New-England whisperings and backbitings; at length
were openly stigmatized as Armenians, and enemies of
the American Vine. The conduct of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>
increased the grievous sin of moderation, and nearly
twenty of their ministers, at the head of whom was Dr.
Cutler, President of Yale College, declared, on a public
commencement, for the Church of England. Hereupon
the General Assembly and Consociation, finding their
comminations likely to blast the American Vine, instantly
had recourse to flattery, larded with tears and
promises, by which means they recovered all the secessors
but four, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Dr. Cutler, Dr. Johnson, Mr. Whitemore,
and Mr. Brown, who repaired to England for
<!--167.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>
holy orders. Dr. Cutler had the misfortune to spend
his life and great abilities in the fanatical, ungrateful,
factious town of Boston, where he went through fiery
trials, shining brighter and brighter, till he was delivered
from New-England persecution, and landed where
the wicked cease from troubling. Dr. Johnson, from
his natural disposition, and not for the sake of gain, took
pity on the neglected church at Stratford, where for
fifty years he fought the beast of Ephesus with great
success.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
The Doctor was under the bountiful protection
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts, incorporated by William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, to save from
the rage of republicanism, heathenism, and fanaticism,
all such members of the Church of England as were
settled in our American colonies, factories, and plantations
beyond the sea. To the foresight of that monarch,
to the generous care and protection of that society, under
God, are owing all the loyalty, decency, christianity
undefiled with blood, which glimmer in New-England.
Dr. Johnson having settled at Stratford among a nest
of zealots, and not being assassinated, other dissenting
ministers were induced to join themselves to the Church
of England, among whom were Mr. Beach and Mr. Penderson.
<!--168.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
These gentlemen could not be wheedled off by
the Assembly and Consociation; they persevered, and
obtained names among the Literate that will never be
forgotten.</p>

<p>The four remaining towns of Fairfield County, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
<span class="location">Newtown</span>, <span class="location">Reading</span>, <span class="location">Danbury</span>, and <span class="location">Ridgfield</span>, lie behind
the towns on the sea. I shall describe the last of them,
which is <span class="location">Danbury</span>. It has much the appearance of Croydon,
and forms five parishes, one of which is episcopal,
and another Sandemanian; a third is called Bastard
Sandemanian, because the minister refused to put away
his wife, who is a second wife. The town was the residence,
and is now the tomb, of the learned and ingenious
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Sandeman, well known to the literary world.
He was the fairest and most candid Calvinist that ever
wrote in the English language, allowing the natural
consequences of all his propositions. He taught that a
bishop must be the husband of one wife—that is, he
must be married before he was ordained—and, if he lost
his wife, he could not marry a second; that a bishop
might dress with ruffles, a red coat, and sword; that all
converted brothers and sisters, at their coming into the
Church, ought to salute with an holy kiss; that all true
christians would obey their earthly king: for which
tenets, especially the last, the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> of Connecticut
held him to be a heretic.</p>

<p>It is strikingly remarkable, that near one-half of the
people of the Dominion of Newhaven are episcopalians,
though it was first settled by the most violent of puritans,
who claimed so much liberty to themselves that
they left none for others. The General Assembly computed
that the Church of England professors amounted
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
to one-third of the whole colony in 1770. Hence has
arisen a question, how it came to pass that the Church
of England increased rapidly in Connecticut, and but
slowly in Massachusets-Bay and Rhode-Island? The
reason appears obvious to me. It is easier to turn
fanatical farmers from their bigotry than to convert
fanatical merchants, smugglers, and fishermen. Pride
and gain prevent the two first, and ignorance the last,
from “worshipping the Lord in the beauty of holiness.”
The General Assembly of Rhode-Island never supported
any religion; nay, lest religion should chance to prevail,
they made a law that every one might do what was right
in his own eyes, with this proviso, that no one should
be holden to pay a note, bond, or vote, made or given
to support the Gospel. Thus barbarism, inhumanity,
and infidelity, must have overrun the colony, had not
its good situation for trade invited Europeans to settle
therein. As to the people of Massachusets-Bay, they,
indeed, had the highest pretensions to religion; but then
it was so impregnated with chicane, mercantile policy,
and insincerity, that infidelity got the better of fanaticism,
and religion was secretly looked upon as a trick of
State. Connecticut was settled by a people who preferred
the arts and sciences to the amusements which
rendered Europe polite; whence it has happened that
their boys and girls are at once amused and improved
in reading, writing, and cyphering, every winter’s night,
whilst those in the neighbouring colonies polish themselves
at cards, balls, and masquerades.</p>

<p>In Connecticut, zeal, though erroneous, is sincere;
each sect believes religion to be a substantial good;
and fanaticism and prejudice have turned it into superstition,
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>
which is stronger than reason or the law of
humanity. Thus it was very observable, that when
any persons conform to the Church of England, they
leave neither their superstition nor zeal at the meetings;
they retrench only fanaticism and cruelty, put on bowels
of mercy, and pity those in error. It should be added,
that every town in the colony is by law obliged to support
a grammar school, and every parish an English
school. From experience, therefore, I judge that superstition
with knowledge and sincerity is more favourable
to religion than superstition with ignorance and insincerity;
and that it was for this reason the Church thrives
in Connecticut, and exists only in New-England provinces.
In further support of my opinion, I shall recite
the words of Mr. George Whitefield, in his first tour
through America in 1740. He found the people of
Connecticut wise in polemical divinity, and told them
much learning had made them mad; that he wished to
leave them with “sleep on and take your rest in the
Bible, in Baxter, Gouge, and Bunyan, without the
knowledge of Bishops’ books.”</p>

<p>Persons who supposed Churchmen in Connecticut
possessed of less zeal and sincerity than the various
sects among the dissenters, are under a mistake; for
they have voluntarily preferred the Church under every
human discouragement, and suffered persecution rather
than persecute. Conducting themselves upon this truly
christian though impolitic principle, they have, in the
space of sixty years, humanized above sixty thousand
puritans, who had ever been hating and persecuting
one another; and though the General Assembly and
Consociation are alarmed at the progress of christian
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>
moderation, yet many individuals among them, perceiving
that persecution declines wherever the Church
prevails, bless God for its growth; whilst the rest, more
zealous for dominion and the politics of their ancestors
the regicides than for the gospel of peace and love,
compass sea and land to export and diffuse that intolerant
spirit which overthrew the Eastern Church and
has cursed the Western. For this purpose they have
sent New-England ministers as missionaries to the
southern colonies, to rouse them out of their religious
and political ignorance; and, what is very astonishing,
they succeeded best with the episcopal clergy, whose
immorality, vanity, or love of self-government, or some
less valuable principle, induced them to join the dissenters
of New-England, against an American bishop,
from a pure intention, they said, of preserving the
Church of England in America. If their reward be
not pointed out in the fable of the Fox and Crane, they
will be more fortunate than most men. Other missionaries
were dispersed among the Six Nations of Indians,
who were under the care of the clergy and schoolmasters
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
There, for a time, wonders were effected; the
Indians were made drunk with zeal. But when their
fanaticism was abated, they cursed the protestant religion,
and ordered the ministers of all denominations to
depart out of their country in a fixed time, on pain of
death. Another band of saints went to Nova-Scotia
to convert the unconverted, under the clergy appointed
by the Bishop of London; among whom, however,
meeting with little encouragement, they shook off the
dust of their feet against them, and returned home.
<!--172.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
These peregrinations, the world was taught to believe,
were undertaken solely to advance the interests of religion;
but righteousness and peace have not yet kissed
each other in New-England; and, besides, the pious
pretences of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> ill accord with their
bitter revilings of the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel, for sending clergymen to promote the spiritual
good of the Churchmen among them.</p>

<p>It is worthy of especial notice, that, among all the
episcopal clergy settled in Connecticut, only one of
them has been accused, even by their enemies, of a
scandalous life, or of any violation of moral law. They
have exercised more patience, resignation, and self-denial,
under their various trials, fatigues, and oppressions,
than can be paralleled elsewhere in the present century.
The countenance of the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and an allowance of 650<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
per annum between eighteen of them, have proved the
means of averting from the professors of the Church of
England that rigour which has constantly marked the
conduct of the General Assembly and Consociation
towards Anabaptists, Quakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Had the bishops
shown as much concern for the welfare of the
Church of England in America as the Society have
done, they would have prevented many reproaches
being cast upon them by the dissenters as hireling shepherds,
and have secured the affections of the American
clergy in every province to themselves, to the King,
and the British Government. If the religion of the
Church of England ought to have been tolerated and
supported in America, (which, considering the lukewarmness
of the bishops in general, even since the
<!--173.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>
Restoration of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, seems to have been a dubious
point,) policy and justice long ago should have
induced the King and Parliament of Great Britain to
have sent bishops to America, that Churchmen at least
might have been upon an equal footing with dissenters.
Against American bishops I have never heard of any
objections, either from the dissenters or the episcopal
clergy south of the Delaware River, so powerful as the
following:</p>

<p>“That the Church of England increases in America,
without bishops, faster than it does in England, where
are bishops to spare.” If the dissenters in America err
not in advancing, as a fact, that in 1715 the Church of
England, under the bishops, had been upon the decline,
and the protestant dissenters upon the increase, in
England, it may be but natural to suppose that the
dissenters in America wish to have the English bishops
resident there, and the dissenters in England to retain
them, as they appear to be so beneficial towards the
growth of the dissenting interests here; and so the dissenters
in both countries disputing about the residence
of the bishops merely because the absence of them is
disadvantageous to the one, and their presence advantageous
to the other, would it not be the best way of
strengthening the interest of both those parties, and
weakening that of the Church of England, to retain
half the bishops in England and send the other half
to America? Against this plan, surely, no dissenter
could object; it will neither add to the national expense
nor to the disadvantage of England or America,
since it promises to be equally serviceable to the protestant
dissenting interest on both sides the Atlantic,
<!--174.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
and will reconcile a difference between the protestant
dissenters, that has been supposen in New-England to
be the reason of bishops not being sent to about one
million episcopalians in America, who are left like
sheep in a wilderness without a shepherd, to the great
danger of the protestant dissenting religion in those
parts. Nor can it be apprehended that this plan of
dividing the bishops will meet with the disapprobation
of the episcopalians, except a few licentious clergymen
in the American southern colonies, who dread their
lordships’ sober advice and coercive power.</p>

<p>Of all the wonders of the English Church, the greatest
is that the rulers of it should hold episcopacy to be
an institution of Christ, and that the Gospel should be
spread among all nations, and, at the same time, should
refuse the American Churchmen a bishop, and the fanatics
and heathen all opportunities of enjoying the Gospel
dispensation in the purity and lustre with which it
shines in the Mother Country. If bishops are necessary,
let America have them; if they are not necessary, let
them be extirpated from the face of the earth; for no
one can be an advocate for their existence merely for
the support of pomp, pride, and insolence, either in
England or America.</p>

<p>The English and Dutch have always kept their colonies
under a state of religious persecution, while the
French and Spanish have acted with generosity in that
respect towards theirs. The Dutch presbyterians in
New-York were held in subordination to the Classis of
Amsterdam, till, a few years since, they discovered that
subjection to be anti-constitutional and oppressive;
upon which a majority of the ministers in their cœtus
<!--175.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>
erected a classis for the ordination of ministers and the
government of their churches, in defiance of the ecclesiastical
judicatory of Amsterdam. Mr. Smith, in his
history of that province, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 252, justifies the schism
upon the following ground: “The expense,” says he,
“attending the ordination of their candidates in Holland,
and the reference of their disputes to the Classis
of Amsterdam, is very considerable; and with what
consequences the interruption of their correspondence
with the European Dutch would be attended, in case
of war, well deserves their consideration.” Nevertheless,
Mr. Smith agrees with his protestant dissenting
neighbours, that the American episcopalians suffered no
hardship in being obliged to incur the same expense in
crossing the Atlantic for ordination. If the Dutch are
justifiable in their schism, I cannot perceive why the
American episcopalians might not be justified in a like
schism from the bishops of London. Had the episcopalians
as little aversion to schism as the protestant dissenters,
the clergy north of the Delaware would, in
1765, have got rid of their regard of an English, and
accepted of a Greek bishop, whom they could have supported
for half the expense their candidates were at in
going to England for ordination. But they were said
by some to be conscientious men, while others said
they were Issachar’s sons couching down beneath their
burthens.</p>

<p>To proceed in my description of the country:</p>

<p>Connecticut is situated between 41 and 42 degrees
of north latitude, and between 72 and 73 degrees 50
minutes west longitude from London. Notwithstanding,
from this latitude, New-London lies 600 miles nearer
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>
the line than the capital of England, the winter sets in
there a month before it does here, and not only continues
longer, but is more severe. This extraordinary
coldness is said by naturalists to arise from the vast
frozen lakes and rivers, and mountains eternally covered
with snow, throughout the northernmost parts of America.
The mountains may have their share in producing
this effect; but I am apt to think the lakes and rivers
have a contrary influence. If I ask why lands bordering
on them are three weeks earlier in their productions
than lands ten miles distant, it will readily be imputed
to the warmth of the air, occasioned by the reflection
of the sun’s rays from the water. On the same principle,
I argue that the rays of the sun, multiplied and
reflected by ice also, will render the air warmer. But
it may be further said, that the cause is perhaps to be
ascribed to the soil being more sandy and loose near a
lake or river, and, therefore, naturally warmer than
that which is remote and not sandy. I reply, that there
are loose, sandy plains, twenty miles off from any lake
or river, three weeks later in their products, and very
perceptibly colder, than lands upon them. It would be
to no purpose to urge that the damps and fogs from
unfrozen lakes, rivers, &amp;c. &amp;c. affect the distant but
not the adjacent country; because I apprehend there
are no unfrozen lakes and rivers in the north of America
in winter. Besides, if there were, the mists arising
from them would naturally be intercepted by the first
mountains or forests they approached. But I pretend
to little philosophical knowledge in these matters; I
write from experience, and can thence, moreover, assert
that mountains with snow upon them are not so
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>
cold as they would be without it; and that mountains
covered with trees are the coldest of all places, but
without trees are not so cold as forests or plains. I
am clearly of opinion, therefore, that not the lakes or
rivers, but the infinite quantity of timber in the immense
regions of North-America, whether upon mountains
or not, is the grand cause of the coldness of the winters
in Connecticut. I will add, moreover, in support
of my argument, that beasts, in the coldest weather, are
observed to quit the woods and woody mountains for
lakes, rivers, and cultivated open country; and that
Connecticut, having lost most of its timber, is by no
means so intensely cold in winter as it was forty years
ago, and as Susquehanna is at present, a wilderness in
the same latitude. The snow and ice commonly cover the
country, without rains, from Christmas to March; then
rains, attended with boisterous winds from the north
and east, melt the snow, which converting brooks into
rivers and rivers into seas, in four or five days the ice
is rent from its groaning banks in such mighty sheets
as it shakes the earth for twenty miles. Nature being
thus in convulsions, the winds turn her fit into madness,
by driving ice upon ice, whose thunders cease not
till the ocean swallows up the whole.</p>

<p>It is but natural to suppose that the summers in
Connecticut are much hotter than those in England;
nevertheless, from the clearness and serenity of the
sky, the climate is healthy both to natives and foreigners
of all nations. Connecticut is a hospital for invalids
of the Islands and southern provinces; but, in general,
they no sooner amend their own constitution, than
the pestilence, which rages in that province, drives
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>
them to Rhode-Island or New-York, where fanaticism
is lost in irreligion.</p>

<p>The people of Connecticut reckon time almost five
hours later than the English. The longest day consists
of fifteen hours, the shortest of nine. The brightness
of the sun, moon, and stars, together with the reverberated
rays on ice, snow, water, trees, mountains, pebbles,
and flat stones, dazzle and weaken the eyes of the
New-Englanders to such a degree, that, in general, they
are obliged to use glasses before they are fifty years of
age. For the most part, also, they have bad teeth,
which has been ascribed to the extreme heats and colds
of summer and winter; but, as the Indians and negroes
in the same climate have remarkably good teeth, it may
be said, with great reason, that the many indulgences
of the one, and the temperance of the other, and not
the heats and colds, are the causes of good and bad
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Soil and Produce.</span>—The soil is various in different
parts of the province: in some black, in others brown,
and elsewhere red, but all rich. Some plains are sandy
and of a whitish colour, and they produce rye, beans,
and Indian-corn. The meadows and lowlands are excellent
pasturage, and yield great crops of hay. The
hills and uplands have a rich, deep soil, but are subject
to droughts in July and August, which in many places
are relieved by water drawn from rivers, ponds, and
brooks, in troughs and ditches. The crops of European
grain are always good, when the snow, which in general
is the only manure, covers the earth from December to
March. One acre generally yields from twenty to thirty
bushels of wheat; of Indian-corn, from forty to sixty
<!--179.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
bushels on even land, and from thirty to forty on hilly
land; but it is to be observed, that one bushel of it raised
on hilly land weighs thirteen pounds more than a bushel
raised on river land. All European grains flourish
here, and the grass is as thick, and much longer than in
England. Maize, or Indian-corn, is planted in hillocks
three feet apart, five kernels and two pumpkin-seeds
in a hillock, and between the hills are planted ten
beans in a hillock; so that, if the season prove favourable,
the beans and the pumpkins are worth as much as
the corn. If from an acre the crop of corn be twenty
bushels, add the beans and pumpkins, and it will be
equal to sixty bushels; so, if there be sixty bushels of
corn, a proportionate growth of beans and pumpkins
will render the product equal to one hundred and eighty
bushels. One man plants an acre in a day; in three
days he hoes the same three times; and six days more
suffice for plowing and gathering the crop. For these
ten days’ work the price is thirty shillings; and, allowing
ten shillings for the use of the land, the whole expense
is two pounds, and no more, while the corn is
worth two shillings a bushel. The gain is seldom less
than 300, and often 600 per cent. It is thus that the
poor man becomes rich in a few years, if prudent and
industrious.</p>

<p>The limits of Connecticut are reckoned to comprise
5,000,000 acres, half of which is supposed to be swallowed
up in rivers, ponds, creeks, and roads. The inhabitants
are estimated at 200,000, so that there remains
but twelve and a half acres for each individual.
Let it now be considered that the people buy no provisions
from other provinces, but, on the contrary, export
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>
full as much as they consume, and it will appear
that each person has in fact only six and a quarter acres
for his own support, two of which must be set apart
for the growth of wood, the only fuel of the colony.
Should I, then, not be justified in saying that Connecticut
is as good and flourishing land as any part of Great
Britain?</p>

<p>The face of the country resembles Devonshire,
Gloucestershire, Surrey, and Kent. The farmers divide
their lands into four, five, and ten acres, with stone
walls or post and rails. The roads from north to south
are generally level and good; from east to west hilly,
and bad for carriages. The various fruits are in greater
perfection than in England. The peach and apple are
more luscious, beautiful, and large; 1000 peaches are
produced from one tree; five or six barrels of cider
from one apple tree. Cider is the common drink at
table. The inhabitants have a method of purifying
cider by frost and separating the watery part from the
spirit, which, being secured in proper vessels, and colored
by Indian-corn, becomes in three months so much
like Madeira wine, that Europeans drink it without perceiving
the difference. They make peachy and perry,
grape, cherry, and currant wines, and good beer of
pumpkin, molasses, bran of wheat, spruce, and malt.
The spruce is the leaves and limbs of the fir tree; their
malt is made of maize, barley, oats, rye, chets, and
wheat. The pumpkin, or pompion, is one of the greatest
blessings, and held very sacred in New-England. It
is a native of America. From one seed often grow
forty pumpkins, each weighing from forty to sixty
pounds, and, when ripe, of the colour of a marigold.
<!--181.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>
Each pumpkin contains about 500 seeds, which, being
boiled to a jelly, is the Indian infallible cure for the
strangury. Of its meat are made beer, bread, custards,
sauce, molasses, vinegar, and, on thanksgiving days, pies,
as a substitute for what the Blue Laws brand as anti-christian
minced pies. Its skin, or shell, serves as a cap
to cut the hair by, (as already mentioned,) and very
useful lanthorns. There are no trees, grain, or fruits,
growing in England but what will grow in Connecticut.
The English oak has been thought much superior to
the American. Whatever policy may be in this opinion,
I will venture to say there is no truth in it in respect
to the white oak in Connecticut, which is tough, close,
hard, and elastic as the whalebone dried. The red,
black, and chestnut oak are, indeed, much inferior to
the white oak. The ash, elm, beech, chestnut, walnut,
hazel, sassafras, sumach, maple, and butternut, are the
chief timber trees of this province, and grow to an
amazing bulk. The last is a native of America, and
takes its name from a nut it produces, of the shape and
size of a pullet’s egg, which contains a meat much larger
than an English walnut, in taste like fresh butter; it
also makes an excellent pickle. The butternut furnishes
fine but tender boards; and its bark dyes black, and
cures cutaneous disorders. In February this tree yields
a sap, of which are made sugar, molasses, and vinegar.
The upland maple also affords a sap equally good, and
both saps make a pleasant beverage without boiling,
and the best punch ever drank in Connecticut.</p>

<p>Here are many iron mines, nay, mountains of iron
ore; and, if they had been attended to with the same
diligence as the farms, they would have supplied Great
<!--182.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
Britain with iron, to the great prejudice of Sweden and
other European nations. For this commercial loss the
inhabitants are indebted to their own quarrels, jealousy,
and religious feuds, together with the intrigues of their
neighbours. Some pig and bar iron they send, out
of pure spite or folly, to New-York and Boston, to
be shipped for England by the merchants there, who
always pay so much less for it as the duty on Swedish
iron amounts to, so that Connecticut allows a duty to
these merchants which they do not pay themselves.</p>

<p>English, Barbary, and Dutch horses abound in this
province; they are not so heavy, but more mettlesome
and hardy than in England. Here are more sheep than
in any two colonies in America; their wool also is better
than that of the sheep in any of the other colonies,
yet not so fine and good as the English. A common
sheep weighs sixty pounds, and sells for a dollar, or 4<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
6<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The horned cattle are not so large as the English;
yet there have been a few instances of oxen six years
old weighing 1900 pounds each. The fat hogs here
excel any in England; many weigh five or six hundred
pounds. Connecticut pork is far superior to any other.</p>

<p>There are only two small parks of deer in Connecticut,
but plenty of rabbits, hares, grey, black, striped
and red squirrels, otters, minks, raccoons, weasels, foxes,
whapperknockers, woodchucks, cubas, and skunks. The
following description of the four last-mentioned animals
may be new to the reader:</p>

<p>The whapperknocker is somewhat larger than a
weasel, and of a beautiful brown colour. He lives in
the woods on worms and birds; is so wild that no one
can tame him, and, as he never quits his harbour in
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
the daytime, is only to be taken by traps in the night.
Of the skins of these animals—which are covered
with an exceedingly fine fur—are made muffs, at the
price of thirty or forty guineas apiece; so that it is not
without reason the ladies pride themselves on the possession
of this small appurtenance of female habiliment.</p>

<p>The woodchuck, erroneously called the badger by
some persons, is of the size of a large raccoon, in form
resembles a Guinea pig, and, when eating, makes a
noise like a hog, whence he is named woodchuck, or
chuck of wood. His legs are short, but his claws
sharp, teeth strong, and courage great on occasions of
self-defence. He burrows in the earth, feeds on clover
and pumpkin during summer, and sleeps all the winter.
His flesh is good to eat, and his skin makes excellent
leather.</p>

<p>The cuba I suppose to be peculiar to New-England.
The male is of the size of a large cat; has four long
tushes sharp as a razor; he is very active in defending
himself, and, if he has the first blow, will spoil a dog
before he yields. His lady is peaceable and harmless,
and depends for protection on her spouse, and, as he
has more courage than prudence, always attends him to
moderate his temper. She sees danger, and he fears it
not. She chatters at him while he is preparing for battle,
and, if she thinks the danger is too great, she runs
to him and clings about his neck, screaming her extreme
distress; his wrath abates, and by her advice they
fly to their caves. In like manner, when he is chained,
and irritated into the greatest rage by an impertinent
dog, his lady, who is never chained, will fly about his
neck and kiss him, and in half a minute restore him to
<!--184.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>
calmness. He is very tender of his family, and never
forsakes them till death dissolves their union. What
further shows the magnanimity of this little animal, he
never manifests the least anger towards his lady, though
I have often seen her extremely loquacious, and, as I
guessed, impertinent to him. How happy would the
rational part of the creation become if they would follow
the example of these irrational beasts! I the more
readily suppose the cuba to be peculiar to New-England,
not only from my never having yet seen the creature
described, but also on account of its perverse observance
of carnival and neglect of <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carême</span>.</p>

<p>The skunk is also peculiar to America, and very
different from the pole-cat, which he is sometimes
called. He is black, striped with white, and of the
size of a small raccoon, with a sharp nose. He burrows
in the earth like a fox, feeds like a fox on fowls and
eggs, and has strong teeth and claws like a fox. He
has long hair, and thick, good fur; is the beauty of the
wilderness; walks slowly, and cannot run as fast as a
man; he is not wild, but very familiar with every creature.
His tail, which is shaggy and about one foot in
length, he turns over his back at pleasure, to make himself
appear larger and higher than he really is. When
his tail is thus lying on his back he is prepared for war,
and generally conquers every enemy that lives by air,
for on this lies his only weapon: about one inch from
his body or rump, in a small bladder or bag, which is
full of essence, whose tint is of the brightest yellow,
and odour somewhat like the smell of garlic, but far
more exquisite and piercing than any volatile spirit
known to chemists. One drop will scent a house to such
<!--185.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
a degree that musk, with the help of brimstone and tar
burnt, will not expel it in six months. The bladder in
which this essence lies is worked by the animal like an
engine, pump, or squirt; and when the creature is assaulted,
he turns his head from his enemy and discharges
from his tail the essence, which fills the neighbouring
air with a mist that destroys the possibility of
living in it. I have seen a large house-dog, by one discharge
of the skunk, retire with shame and sickness;
and, at another time, a bullock bellowing as if a dog had
held him by the nose. Were it not for man, no creature
could kill this animal, which, instead of the lion, ought
to be crowned king of animals, as well on account of
his virtues and complaisance as his courage. He knows
his forte; he fears nothing, he conquers all; yet he is
civil to all, and never gives, as he will not take, offence.
His virtues are many. The wood of calambac, which
cures fainting-fits and strokes of the palsy, and is worth
its weight in gold, is far less valuable than the above-mentioned
essence of this animal. The bag is extracted
whole from the tail, and the essence preserved in glass;
nothing else will confine it. One drop sufficiently impregnates
a quart of spring water, and half a gill of
water thus impregnated is a dose. It cures hiccups,
asthmatic, hysteric, paralytic, and hectic disorders, and
the odour prevents faintness. The flesh of this animal
is excellent food, and its oil cures sprains and contractions
of the sinews.</p>

<p>The feathered tribe in Connecticut are the turkey,
geese, ducks, and all kinds of barn-door poultry; innumerable
flocks of pigeons, which fly to the south in
the autumn; cormorants of all sizes; hawks, owls, ravens,
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
and crows; partridges, quails, heath-hen, blackbirds,
snipes, larks, humility’s, whippoorwills, dew-minks,
robins, wrens, swallows, sparrows, the flax, crimson,
white, and blue birds, &amp;c. &amp;c.; to which I may add the
humming-bird, though it might wantonly be styled the
empress of the honey-bees, partaking with them of the
pink, tulip, rose, daisy, and other aromatics.</p>

<p>The partridges in New-England are nearly as large
as a Dorking fowl, the quail as an English partridge,
and the robin twice as big as those in England. The
dew-mink, so named from its articulating those syllables,
is black and white, and the size of an English
robin. Its flesh is delicious. The humility is so called
because it speaks the word humility, and seldom mounts
high in the air. Its legs are long enough to enable it
to outrun a dog for a little way; its wings long and
narrow; body maigre and of the size of a blackbird’s;
plumage variegated with white, black, blue, and red.
It lives on tadpoles, spawn, and worms; has an eye
more piercing than the falcon, and the swiftness of an
eagle; hence it can never be shot, for it sees the
sparks of fire even before it enkindles the powder, and
by the extreme rapidity of its flight gets out of reach in
an instant. It is never known to light upon a tree, but
is always seen upon the ground or wing. These birds
appear in New-England in summer only; what becomes
of them afterwards is not discovered. They are caught
in snares, but can never be tamed.</p>

<p>The whippoorwill has so named itself by its nocturnal
songs. It is also called the Pope, by reason of its
darting with great swiftness from the clouds to the
ground and bawling out Pope, which alarms young people
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>
and the fanatics very much, especially as they know
it to be an ominous bird. However, it has hitherto
proved friendly, always giving travellers and others notice
of an approaching storm by saluting them every
minute by Pope! pope! It flies only a little before
sunset, unless for this purpose of giving notice of a
storm: It never deceives the people with false news.
If the tempest is to continue long, the augurs appear in
flocks, and nothing can be heard but Pope! pope! The
whippoorwill is about the size of a cuckoo, has a short
beak, long and narrow wings, a large head, and mouth
enormous, yet is not a bird of prey. Under its throat
is a pocket, which it fills with air at pleasure, whereby
it sounds forth the fatal word Pope in the day, and
Whip-her-I-will in the night. The superstitious inhabitants
would have exorcised this harmless bird long ago,
as an emissary from Rome and an enemy to the American
Vine, had they not found out that it frequents New-England
only in the summer, and prefers the wilderness
to a palace. Nevertheless, many cannot but believe
it a spy from some foreign court, an agent of antichrist,
a lover of persecution, and an enemy of protestants,
because it sings of whipping, and of the Pope, which
they think portends misery and a change of religion.</p>

<p>The principal insects are the hornet, bull-fly, glow-bug,
humble-bee, and black and yellow wasp.</p>

<p>The bull-fly is armed with a coat of mail, which it
can move from one place to another, as sliders to a window
are moved. Its body is about an inch long, and
its horns half an inch, very sharp and strong. It has
six feet, with claws as sharp as needles, and runs fast.
In sucking the blood or juice of its prey, the creature
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>
holds the same in its claws; otherwise the prey is carried
between its horns.</p>

<p>The glow-bug both crawls and flies, and is about
half an inch long. These insects fly, in the summer
evenings, nearly seven feet from the ground, in such
multitudes that they afford sufficient light for the people
to walk by. The brightness, however, is interrupted
by twinklings; but they are instantaneous and short as
those of the eye, so that darkness no sooner takes place
than it vanishes.</p>

<p>The humble-bee is almost as large as the humming-bird,
but cannot fly near so fast. It builds its nest in
the ground, where it makes a honey-comb of the size
of a man’s hand, and fills it with bees’-bread, wax, and
honey, excelling that of the honey-bee in taste. Two
or three begun, and having shortly multiplied to about
forty, the young ones leave home as soon as they can
fly, to begin new settlements. These bees are wrongly
named: they are warriors, and only want a quantity of
poison to be more fatal than rattle-snakes.</p>

<p>The honey-bees can sting but once, while the humble-bee
will sting a thousand times. Their body is
black and white; wings of a Doric colour; sight piercing,
hearing quick, and temper cruel.</p>

<p>Among the reptiles of Connecticut are the black,
the water, milk, and streaked snakes, all harmless. The
belled or rattle-snakes are large, and will gorge a common
cat. They are seldom seen from their rocky dens.
Their bite is mortal if not speedily cured; yet they are
generous, and without guile; before they bite they rattle
their bells three or four times, but after that their
motion is swift and stroke sure. The Indians discovered
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>
and informed the English of a weed, common in the
country, which, mixed with spittle, will extract the
poison.</p>

<p>The toads and frogs are plenty in the spring of the
year. The tree-frogs, whippoorwills, and whooping owls,
serenade the inhabitants every night with music far excelling
the harmony of the trumpet, drum, and jews-harp.</p>

<p>The tree-frog cannot be called an insect, a reptile, or
one of the winged host; he has four legs, the two foremost
short, with claws as sharp as those of a squirrel;
the hind-legs five inches long, and folding by three
joints. His body is about as big as the first joint of a
man’s thumb. Under his throat is a wind-bag, which
assists him in singing the word I-sa-ac all the night.
When it rains, and is very dark, he sings the loudest.
His voice is not so pleasing as that of the nightingale;
but this would be a venial imperfection, if he would
but keep silence on Saturday nights, and not forever
prefer I-sa-ac to Abraham and Jacob. He has more
elasticity in his long legs than any other creature yet
known. By this means he will leap five yards up a
tree, fastening himself to it by his fore legs, and in a
moment will hop or spring as far from one tree to another.
It is from the singing of the tree-frog that the
Americans have acquired the name of Little Isaac. Indeed,
like a certain part of them, the creature appears
very devout, noisy, arbitrary, and phlegmatic, and associates
with none but what agree with him in his ways.</p>

<p>The oysters, clams, quauhogs, lobsters, crabs, and
fish, are innumerable. The shad, bass, and salmon,
more than half support the province. The sturgeon is
<!--190.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>
made no use of. From the number of seines employed
to catch the fish passing up to the lakes, one might be
led to suppose the whole must be stopped; yet, in six
months’ time they return to the sea with such multitudes
of young ones as to fill Connecticut River for
many days, and no finite being can number them.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Population and Inhabitants.</span>—Connecticut, in proportion
to its extent, exceeds every other colony of English
America, as well in the abundance of people as in
cultivation of soil. The number of the first settlers at
Saybrook, in 1634, was 200; in 1636, at Hertford, 106;
in 1637, at Newhaven, 157; in all, 463. In 1670 the
residents of these three settlements amounted to 15,000,
of whom 2000 were men capable of bearing arms; the
rest old men, women, and children. In 1680 the residents
were 20,000; in 1770, 200,000. Hence it appears
that the people of Connecticut did, during the 90 years,
double their number ten times over. Should the 200,000
which existed in Connecticut in 1770 double their
number in the same manner for the ensuing 90 years,
the province will, in the year 1860, contain 2,000,000;
and if the fighting men should then be in the same
proportion to the rest of the inhabitants as they were
in 1670, they will amount to no less than 266,000. I
see no reason in Nature why it may not be so.</p>

<p>Since 1670, emigration from Europe, or elsewhere,
to Connecticut, has been trifling, in comparison to the
emigration from Connecticut to New-Jersey, Newhampshire,
Massachusets-Bay, Nova-Scotia, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Manufactures.</span>—The inhabitants manufacture coarse

use; they spin much cotton and flax, and make common
and the best kind of beaver hats. Ship-building is a
great branch of business in Connecticut, which is carried
on much cheaper than in Europe, by means of saw-mills
worked by water. The planks are cut by a gang of ten
or twelve saws, more or less, as occasion requires, while
the carriage is backed but once. Great part of the ship-timber
is also cut by water. Anchor-making is done
by water and trip-hammers, without much fatigue to
the workmen. Distilling and paper-making increase
every year. Here are many rope-walks, which want
neither hemp nor flax; and formerly here were rolling
and slitting works, but they have been suppressed by
an act of Parliament, to the ruin of many families.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Commerce.</span>—The exports of Connecticut consist
chiefly of all sorts of provisions, pig and bar iron, pot
and pearl ashes, staves, lumber, boards, iron pots and kettles,
anchors, planks, hoops, shingles, live cattle, horses,
&amp;c. &amp;c. To what amount these articles are annually
exported, may be judged from the following very low
estimate:</p>

besides hay, fish, &amp;c. &amp;c. The salmon, large and small,
are exported both pickled and dried.</p>

<p>In the above statement of exports I have allowed
only for horses bred in the colony, and not for those
brought for exportation from Canada and other northern
parts, which are very numerous. The calculation
of the wheat, the common price of which is three shillings
sterling per bushel, is founded upon the allowed
circumstance of the exportation being equal to the consumption,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 2,600,000 bushels among 200,000 persons,
according to the acknowledged necessary portion
of thirteen bushels to one person. The pork is estimated
according to the reputed number of houses in
the province, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 30,000, allowing one and a quarter
barrels for each house, at 2<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per barrel.</p>

<p>The imports in 1680, when the number of inhabitants
was 20,000, amounted to 10,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, i. e. at the rate
of 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> for each individual. Supposing the increase of
imports only to keep pace with that of the people, they
would, in 1770, when the province contained 200,000
souls, amount to 100,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; but I believe that to be
not above one-quarter of their value.</p>

<p>Boston, New-York, and Newport, have the greatest
share of the exports of Connecticut, and pay for them
in English or Dutch goods at cent. per cent. profit to
themselves, upon a moderate computation. What few
of them are sent from the colony to the West Indies,
are paid for honourably in rum, molasses, sugar, salt,
brandy, cotton, and money.</p>

<p>Consequences very prejudicial attend the commerce
of Connecticut, thus principally carried on through the
medium of the neighbouring colonies. I will here
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>
point out one material instance: Connecticut pork, a
considerable article of exportation, excels all others in
America, and fetches a halfpenny per pound more.
Of this difference in the price the merchants in New-York,
Boston, &amp;c. have taken care to avail themselves,
by mixing their own inferior pork with that of Connecticut,
and then selling the whole at the full price of
the latter. This fair dealing was managed thus: The
pork of Connecticut was packed up in barrels, each of
which, according to statute regulations, must weigh 220
lbs. and contain not more than six legs and three half
heads. The packer is to mark the barrel before it is
shipped, and is liable to a heavy punishment if there
should be found four half heads and seven legs in the
barrel when it is delivered for exportation. But of
large pork, two legs and half a head will be a sufficient
proportion of those parts in a barrel. This gives the
New-York and Bostonian merchants an opportunity of
taking out the best part of the Connecticut pork, and
substituting in its place an equal weight of their own,
whereby it often happens that four legs and two half
heads are found in a barrel of reputed Connecticut
pork. Though it then remains a barrel according to
the statute, it cannot but be supposed that the practice
must greatly hurt the credit of Connecticut pork with
all who are not apprised that it passes through the
renounded provinces of Massachusets-Bay and New-York.</p>

<p>The people of Connecticut have long been sensible
of the many great impositions and disadvantages which
beset their commercial system; yet, though sufficient
power is in their own hands, they have no inclination
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
or resolution to attempt a reformation of it. The reason
is, the mutual animosities and rancour subsisting
between the dominions of New-London, Hertford, and
Newhaven, each of which prefers the general ruin of
the province to a coalition upon any terms short of conquest.
The seeds of this discord were thus sown by
these two insidious neighbours. The port of New-London
is by far the best in the province, and extremely
well calculated for its capital and grand commercial emporium;
and about fifty years since, a number of merchants
there began to export and import goods, seemingly
to the satisfaction of the whole colony, but to the
great displeasure and chagrin of those of New-York
and Boston, whom it threatened with ruin. Something
was necessary to be done. The poor Bostonians, according
to custom, privately sent for their faithful allies at
Hertford, to infuse into them an idea that their town
ought to be the capital, and not New-London, which
belonged to the Dominion of Sassacus, who had murdered
so many christians; adding that, if they would
engage in such an attempt in favour of Hertford, the
Boston merchants would supply them with goods
cheaper than they could buy them at New-London.
The good people at Hertford, forgetting their river
was frozen for five months in the year, remembering
how they had obtained their Charter, hating Sassacus,
and loving self, immediately gave in to the designing
Bostonians’ suggestions, and refused to receive any
more goods from New-London. The friendly Mynheers
of New-York played off a similar trick upon Newhaven,
and promised to support that town as the capital of the
colony. The plots succeeded. Contentions and quarrels
<!--195.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
arose among the three parties, the effects of which
remain to this day. The merchants of New-London
were obliged to quit Connecticut, and the trade of the
province was chiefly divided between New-York and
Boston, at cent. per cent. disadvantage to an ill-natured
colony, and at the same time advantage to its cunning
neighbours. When party spirit yields to self-interest,
New-London will again become the emporium of Connecticut,
where merchants will settle and import goods
from foreign countries at 35<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per cent. extra profit to
the consumers, and 15<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per cent. extra profit to themselves,
and withal save as much in the exports from
Connecticut, by taking the full price and bounty of its
goods at foreign markets, instead of yielding the same
to the people of New-York and Boston, who have too
long kept 200,000 as negroes on their own farms, to
support twice 20,000 artful citizens. Thus has Connecticut,
by contention and folly, impoverished and
kept in obscurity the most fruitful colony in America,
to support the fame and grandeur of Boston and New-York
among the trading nations of Europe. When I
view the less fertile soil of Boston, the conscience of
merchants, the pride of the pretended Gospel ministers,
the blindness of bigotry, and the mercantile ignorance
of farmers, I forgive Boston, New-York, and Rhode-Island,
but condemn Connecticut. I will leave a legacy
to the people of my native country, which possibly may
heal their divisions, and render them partial to their
own province, as the Bostonians are to theirs. It consists
of two lines:</p>

<span class="subtitle">Revenue and Expenditure.</span>—In 1680 the whole corporation
were estimated to be worth 120,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> They
had 30 small vessels, 26 churches, and, as above mentioned,
20,000 inhabitants. If their value had increased
only in proportion with the inhabitants, who, as I have
said, amounted to 200,000 in 1770, the corporation
would then have been worth no more than 1,200,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>,
a sum not equal to 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per acre, though in a great
measure cultivated, and surrounded with stone walls
which alone cost 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> by the rod; but in that year, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
1770; land sold in Connecticut from 4<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to 50<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per acre;
their vessels, also, had increased to about 1200, and the
churches—least in proportion—to about 300. The true
method, therefore, of forming the valuation of Connecticut
in 1770, is not by calculating upon this State
in 1680, but by estimating the number of its acres, appreciating
them by purchases then made, and adding a
due allowance for the stock, &amp;c. Now, Connecticut has
been reputed to contain 2,500,000 solid acres, which, at
the very moderate price of 8<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> each, are worth 20,000,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
sterling; and 14,000,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> being added as a reasonable
allowance for stock, shipping, &amp;c. the whole valuation
of Connecticut would amount to 34,000,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
The annual income, supposing the 2,500,000 acres and
stock rented at 10<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per acre, one with another, would
be 1,250,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> A list of rateables, called the General
List, is the foundation upon which the revenue is raised
in Connecticut, being the valuation of a man’s property

<p>Every person annually gives his list, specifying the
property he possesses, to the selectmen, who send the
sum total of each town to the General Assembly, when
a tax of one shilling, more or less, according to public
exigencies, is imposed on each pound.</p>

<p>According to the general list of the colony for 1770,
I have underrated its annual worth, which then was
fixed at 2,000,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; for, though that list includes the
poll-tax of 18<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per head for all males above sixteen and
under sixty years of age, the faculty tax, and the tax on
shipping, all which may amount to 600,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, there
nevertheless remains a surplus of 150,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> above my
calculation. But, supposing a tax of one shilling in the
pound (the common colonial assessment) on 1,250,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>,
the produce will be 62,500<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, exclusive of the poll, faculty,
and other taxes. Small, however, as this assessment
is, it has never been collected without much difficulty
and clamour; yet the people lose, by trading with
Boston, New-York, and Newport, in exports and imports,
600,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> annually; and that for nothing but to

<p>An account of some of these sects is to be found in
the history of Munster; but the Bowlists, Separatists,
and Davisonians are peculiar to the colony. The first
allow of neither singing nor prayer; the second permit
only the elect to pray; and the third teach universal
salvation, and deny the existence of a hell or devils.
The presbyterians and episcopalians are held by all to
be the enemies of Zion and the American Vine; nay,
the former are even worse hated than the Churchmen,
because they appear to be dissenters, and are not genuine
enemies to episcopacy, but “hold the truth in unrighteousness.”
Some travellers have called the fanatical
sects of Connecticut by the general name of Legionists,
because they are many; and others have called them
Pumguntums, Cantums, &amp;c. because they groan and
sing with a melancholy voice their prayers, sermons, and
hymns. This disgusting tone has utterly excluded
oratory from them; and did they not speak the English
in greater perfection than any other of the Americans,
few strangers would disoblige them with their company.
Their various systems are founded upon those of Peters,
Hooker, and Davenport, of which I have already
spoken; yet the modern teachers have made so many
<!--200.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>
new-fangled refinements in the doctrine and discipline
of those patriarchs, and of one another, as render their
passions for ecclesiastical innovation and tyranny equally
conspicuous. But the whole are enveloped with superstition,
which here passes for religion, as much as it
does in Spain, France, or among the savages.</p>

<p>I will instance that of an infant, in 1761. Some
children were piling sand-heaps in Hertford, when a
boy, only four years old, hearing it thunder at a distance,
left his companions and ran home to his mother, crying
out, “Mother, mother, give me my book, for I heard
God speaking to me!” His mother gave him his book,
and he read A, B, C, D, &amp;c.; then gave up his book,
saying, “Here, mother, take my book; I must go to my
sand-houses: now I am not afraid of all the thunder
and lightning in the world.”</p>

<p>As to their government, we may compare it to the
regularity of a mad mob in London, with this exception:
the mob acts without law, and the colonists by law.
They teach that legal righteousness is not saving grace.
Herein they are right; but it appears they believe not
their own doctrine, for legal righteousness is their only
shield and buckler. In January County Court, at Hertford
only, 1768, there were about 3000 suits on the
docket; and there are four of these courts in a year,
and perhaps never less suits at a court than 2000.</p>

<p>In the course of this work my readers must necessarily
have observed, in some degree, the ill effects of
the democratical constitution of Connecticut. I would
wish them to imagine, for I feel myself unable adequately
to describe, the confusion, turbulence, and convulsion
arising in a province where not only every civil
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>
officer, from the governor to the constables, but also
every minister, is appointed as well as paid by the
people, and faction and superstition are established.
The clergy, lawyers, and merchants or traders, are the
three efficient parties which guide the helm of the government.
Of these, the most powerful is the clergy,
and, when no combinations are formed against them,
they may be said to rule the whole province; for they
lead the women captive, and the women the men; but
when the clergy differ with the lawyers and merchants,
the popular tide turns. In like manner, when the clergy
and lawyers contend with the merchants, it turns against
these; and is the same when the clergy and merchants
unite against the lawyers. This fluctuation of power
gives a strange appearance to the body politic at large.
In Hertford, perhaps, the clergy and merchants are
agreed, and prevail; in Weathersfield, the clergy and
lawyers; in Middletown, the lawyers and merchants;
and so on, again and again, throughout the colony.
Thus the General Assembly becomes an assembly of
contending factions, whose different interests and pursuits
it is generally found necessary mutually to consult
in order to produce a sufficient coalition to proceed
on the business of the State.—<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vos ipsos pseudo-patres
patriæ, veluti in speculo aspicite?</span>—Sometimes, in quarrels
between the merchants and lawyers of a particular
parish, the minister is allowed to stand neuter; but, for
the most part, he is obliged to declare on the one side
or the other; he then, remembering from whence he
gets his bread, espouses that which appears to be the
strongest, whether it be right or wrong, and his declaration
never fails to turn the adverse party.—<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">En rabies</span>

<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulgi!</span>—I must beg leave to refer my readers to their
own reflections upon such a system of government as I
have here sketched out.</p>

<p>The historians of New-England boast much of the
happiness all parties there enjoy in not being subject,
as in England, to sacramental test by way of qualification
for preferment in the State; on which account,
with peculiar propriety, it might be called a free country.
The truth is, there never has been occasion for such a
test-act. The Assemblies never appointed any, because
the magistrates are annually chosen by the people, of
whom the far greater part are church members; and
this church-membership, in its consequences, destroys
all liberty in a communicant, who is necessitated to
swear to promote the interests of that church he is a
member of, and is duly informed by the minister what
that interest is. The minister is the eye of conscience
to all freemen in his parish, and tells them that they
will perjure themselves if they give their votes to an
episcopalian, or any person who is not a member of
the Church of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>. Those freemen
dare not go counter to the minister’s dictate, any more
than a true Mussulman dare violate the sacred law of
Mahomet. What need, then, is there of a civil test,
when a religious test operates much more powerfully,
and will ever keep Churchmen, Separatists, Quakers,
Baptists, and other denominations from governmental
employments in Connecticut, and confine them to the
Old and New Lights; whilst the test act in England
prevents no dissenter from holding any civil or military
commission whatsoever? Upon this subject Mr. Neal
has exerted himself in so signal a manner, that he ought
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>
to be styled the Champion of New-England. He represents
that there were two State factions in New-England:
the one out of place he calls spies and malcontents,
chiefly because they had no share in the government.
He adds, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 615: “I can assure the world that
religion is no part of the quarrel; for there is no sacramental
test for preferment in the State.”--Many
people in New-England have not been able to assign a
reason for Mr. Neal’s choosing to hide one truth by
telling another, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that there was no statute in New-England
to oblige a man to receive the sacrament
among the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> as a qualification for civil
office. This assertion is really true; and when Mr.
Neal speaks a truth, he, above all men, ought to have
credit for it. But Mr. Neal well knew it to be the
truth, also, that no man could be chosen a corporal in
the train-band unless he was a member of the Church
of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, because then every voter was
subject to a religious test of the Synod or Consociation.
Mr. Neal, indeed, seems to think that a civil test is
heresy itself, but that a religious test is liberty, is gospel,
and renders “all parties of christians in New-England
easy—a happy people.” The reason, however,
of his muffling truth with truth, was, he wrote for the
Old Lights and against the New Lights for hire; the
New Lights being the minority, and out of place in the
State. Those two sects differed about the coercive
power of the civil magistrate. The Old Lights held
that the civil magistrate was a creature framed on purpose
to support ecclesiastical censure with the sword of
severity; but the New Lights maintained that the magistrate
had no power or right to concern himself with
<!--204.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
Church excommunication, and that excommunication
was all the punishment any one could undergo in this
world, according to the rules of the Gospel. These
were, and always have been, two great articles of faith in
New-England; nevertheless, Mr. Neal says he can assure
the world that “religion is no part of the quarrel.”
I hope Mr. Neal did not mean to quibble, as the New-Englanders
generally do, by Jesuitism, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that religion
is peaceable and admits not of quarrels; and yet, if he
did not, he meant not a full representation of the matter,
for he well knew that the difference in respect to
the intent and power of the magistrates was a religious
point, and formed the partition wall between the Old
and New Lights. The civilians and magistrates were
too wise to countenance the New Lights, who promised
little good to them; while the Old Lights gave them
a power of punishing, even unto death, those whom
they had anathematized, and who would not submit to
their censures by penitence and confession. The Old
Lights, in short, supported the practice of the inquisitors
of Spain and Archbishop Laud—the ostensible occasion
of their ancestors flying from England to the
wilderness of America.</p>

<p>But Mr. Neal contented not himself with one mistake;
he added, “that the people of New-England are a
dutiful and loyal people.” They never merited this
character, and they always had too much honesty and
religion to claim it. From the first they have uniformly
declared, in Church and State, that America is a new
world, subject to the people residing in it, and that
none but enemies of the country would appeal from
their courts to the King in Council. They never have
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>
prayed for any earthly king by name. They have always
called themselves republicans, and enemies to
kingly government, to temporal and spiritual lords.
They hate the idea of a Parliament, consisting of King,
Lords, and Commons; they declare that the three
branches should be but one, the king having only a
single vote with the other members. Upon this point
they have always quarrelled with the governors. They
never have admitted one law of England to be in force
among them till passed by their assemblies. They have
sent agents to fight against the kings of England. They
deny the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London, which
extends over America by a royal patent. They hold
Jesus to be the only King, whom if they love and obey
they will not submit, because they have not submitted,
to the laws of the King of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Mr. Neal, furthermore, professes his want of conception
why the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts should send missionaries into
New-England, when Oliver Cromwell had, in 1640, instituted
a society to propagate christian knowledge
there. Mr. Neal might have learnt the cause of this
phenomenon from the charter granted to the first-mentioned
society by King William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, who was a friend
to civil and christian liberty, and who endeavoured to
suppress the intolerable persecutions in his days prevailing
in New-England. But, besides, Mr. Neal could
not but know that there were many Churchmen in New-England
desirous of the use of the liturgy and discipline
of the English Church; and for what reason should
they not have ministers of their own persuasion, as well
as the sober and conscientious dissenters? I hope my
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>
readers will not think me a partial advocate for the
Church of England, which, perhaps, has lost the opportunity
of civilizing, christianizing, and moderating the
burning zeal of the dissenters of New-England, who
were honest in their religion merely by the sinful omission
of not sending a bishop to that country, who would
have effected greater things among them than an army
of 50,000 men. I avow myself to be liberal-minded
towards all sects and parties; and, if I had power, I
would convert all sorts of ministers into popes, cardinals,
prelates, dominies, potent presbyters, and rich
Quakers, that the world might be excused from hearing
again of preaching, defamation, insurrections, and spiritual
jurisdictions, which result more from pride, poverty,
avarice, and ambition, than the love of peace and christianity.</p>

<p>It has been said by the deists, and other politicians,
that ministers, by preaching, have done more hurt
than good in the christian world. If the idea will
hold in any part it will be in New-England, where each
sect preaches, for Gospel, policy and defamation of its
neighbour; whence the lower classes think that christianity
consists in defending their own peculiar Church
and modes, and subverting those of others, at any rate;
while the higher ranks value religion and the Gospel as
laws of a foreign country, and the merchants powwowers,
subtle, cruel, and greedy of riches and dominion
over all people. For this reason the savages have taken
an aversion to the protestant religion, and they say
they would rather follow Hobbomockow and the Roman
priests than New-England christians, who persecute one
another, and killed their ancestors with a pocky Gospel.
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>
With scorn they cry out: “We value not your Gospel,
which shews so many roads to Kicktang; some of
them must be crooked, and lead to Hobbomockow.
We had, therefore, better continue Indians like our
ancestors, or be Catholics, who tell us of only one way
to Kicktang, or the invisible God.”</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Laws.</span>—A stranger in the colony, upon hearing the
inhabitants talk of religion, liberty, and justice, would
be induced to believe that the christian and civil virtues
were their distinguishing characteristics; but he
soon finds his mistake in fixing his abode among
them. Their laws grind the poor, and their religion
is to oppress the oppressed. The poll-tax is unjust
and cruel. The poor man is compelled to pay for his
bread eighteen shillings per annum, work four days
on the highways, serve in the militia four days, and
pay three shillings for his hut, without a window in
it. The best house and richest man in the colony pays
no more!</p>

<p>The law is pretended to exempt episcopalians, Anabaptists,
Quakers, and others, from paying rates to the
<span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, but, at the same time, gives the <span class="title">Sober
Dissenters</span> power to tax them for minister, school, and
town rates, by a general quota; and no law or court can
put asunder what the town has joined together. The
law also exempts from paying to <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> all
Churchmen “who live so near that they can and do attend
Church.” But hence, if a man is sick, and does
not attend more than twenty-six Sabbaths in a year, he
becomes legally a <span class="title">Sober Dissenter</span>; and if the meeting
lies between him and the Church, he does not live so
near the Church that he can attend, because it is more
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
than a Sabbath-day’s journey, and therefore unnecessary
travel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The law provides whipping, stocks, and fines, for
such as do not attend public worship on the Sabbath.
The Grand Jury complains, and the Justice inflicts the
punishment. This has been the practice for many years.
About 1750, Mr. Pitt, a Churchman, was whipped for
not attending meeting. Mr. Pitt was an old man. The
episcopal clergy wrote to England, complaining of this
cruel law. The Governor and Council immediately
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>
broke the Justice who punished Mr. Pitt, and wrote to
the Bishop of London that they had done so as a mark
of their disapprobation of the Justice’s conduct, and
knew not what more they could do. This apology satisfied
the Bishop, and the next year the Governor and
Council restored the Justice to his office; however,
Quakers and Anabaptists only were whipped afterwards.</p>

<p>Formerly, when a <span class="title">Sober Dissenter</span> had a suit in law
against a Churchman, every juryman of the latter persuasion
was by the Court removed from the jury and
replaced by <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>. The reasons assigned for
this extraordinary conduct was, “that justice and impartiality
might take place.” The episcopalians, Quakers,
and other sects not of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, were not
admitted to serve as jurymen in Connecticut till 1750.
Such of them whose annual worth is rated at not less
than 40<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> in the general list, have enjoyed the liberty of
voting for civil officers a much longer term; but for
parish concerns they are still totally excluded.</p>

<p>Other laws I have occasionally animadverted upon
in the course of this work; and a specimen of the Blue
Laws, and of various courts, is inserted.</p>

<p>Nothing can reflect greater disgrace upon the colony
than the number of suits in all the County Courts,
amounting in the whole to between 20 and 30,000
annually; the greater part of which are vexatiously
commenced from expectations grounded upon the notorious
instability of the judges’ opinions and decisions.</p>

<p>The spirit of litigation which distracts the province
in general is, however, a blessing to the judges and
lawyers. The court has one shilling for every action
called, and twenty shillings for those that come to trial;
<!--210.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>
and the fee to each lawyer is twenty shillings, whether
the action be tried or not, besides various other expenses.
There are as many suits of conscience before
the justices of the peace, and ministers, and deacons;
so that the sum annually expended in law in the whole
colony is amazing. It was not without reason, therefore,
that the judges, the lawyers, the ministers and
deacons, the sheriffs and constables, opposed the stamp-act
with all their might. They told the people that, if
this act took place, their liberties would be destroyed,
and they would be tried by King’s judges without jury.</p>

<p>The singular nature of some of the suits entitles them
to particular notice. When the ice and flood prevail in
the great river Connecticut, they frequently carry off
large pieces of ground on one side, and carry them over
to the other. By this means the river is every year
changing its bed, to the advantage of some persons and
the disadvantage of others. This has proved the source
of perplexing lawsuits, and will most likely continue
to produce the same effects so long as the demi-annual
assemblies remain in the colony; for the judgment of
the Assembly in May is rescinded by that in October,
and so <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span>. Thus a lawsuit in Connecticut is
endless, to the ruin of both plaintiff and defendant.</p>

<p>The County and Superior Courts, also, in different
years give different judgments; and the reason is the
popular constitution of the colony, whereby different
parties prevail at different times, each of whom carefully
undoes what the others have done. Thus the glorious
uncertainty of the law renders the possession of
property in Connecticut extremely precarious. The
question, however, touching the lands being removed
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>
from place to place by the floods and ice, requires the
skill of both juries and casuists. The most simple case
of the kind that has been communicated to me is the
following:</p>

<p>A piece of land belonging to A., in Springfield, with
a house, &amp;c. standing upon it, was removed by the flood
to another town, and settled on land belonging to W.
A. claimed his house and land, and took possession of
them; whereupon W. sued A. for a trespass, and the
court ejected A. But A. afterward obtained a revision
of the judgment; when W. again sued A., and got a
decree that A. should remove his own land off from
the land of W., or pay W. for his land. Further litigation
ensued, both parties pleading that the act of God
injured no man according to the English law. The
judges said that the act of God in this case equally
fell upon A. and W. The dispute rests <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</span>,
the jurisprudence of Connecticut not having yet taught
mankind what is just and legal in this important controversy.</p>

<p>Supposing the flood had carried A.’s ship or raft on
W.’s land, the ship or raft would still belong to A., and
W. could recover damages; but then A. must take away
his ship or raft in a reasonable time. Yet, in the case
where an island, or point of land, is removed by the
waters, or an earthquake, upon a neighbouring shore,
<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="Question">Q.</abbr></span> Ought not the islanders to keep possession of the
superficies? This may be a new case in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Manners and Customs.</span>—Gravity and serious deportment,
together with shyness and bashfulness, generally
attend first communications with the inhabitants
of Connecticut; but after a short acquaintance they become
<!--212.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>
very familiar, and inquisitive about news. Who
are you? whence come you? where going? what is
your business? and what your religion? They do not
consider these, and similar questions, impertinent, and
consequently expect a civil answer. When the stranger
has satisfied their curiosity, they will treat him with all
the hospitality in their power, and great caution must
be observed to get quit of them and their houses without
giving offence. If the stranger has cross and difficult
roads to travel, they will go with him till all danger
is past, without fee or reward. The stranger has
nothing to do but civilly say, “Sir, I thank you, and
will call upon you when I return.” He must not say,
“God bless you,” or “I shall be glad to see you at my
house,” unless he is a minister; because they hold
that the words “God bless you” should not be spoken
by common people; and “I shall be glad to see you at
my house” they look upon as an insincere compliment,
paid them for what they do out of duty to the stranger.
Their hospitality is highly exemplary; they are sincere
in it, and reap great pleasure by reflecting that, perhaps,
they have entertained angels.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. George Whitefield, in one of his sermons,
gave them the following character: “I have
found,” said he, “the people of Connecticut the
wisest of any upon the continent; they are the best
friends and the worst enemies; they are hair-brained
bigots on all sides, and they may be compared to the
horse and mule, without bit and bridle. In other
colonies I have paid for food and lodging, but could
never spend one penny in fruitful Connecticut, whose
banks flow with milk and honey, and whose sons and
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>
daughters never fail to feed and refresh the weary
traveller, without money and without price.”</p>

<p>On Saturday evenings the people look sour and sad;
on the Sabbath they appear to have lost their dearest
friends, and are almost speechless; they walk softly;
they even observe it with more exactness than did the
Jews. A Quaker preacher told them, with much truth,
that they worshipped the Sabbath, and not the God of
the Sabbath. These hospitable people, without charity,
condemned the Quaker as a blasphemer of the holy Sabbath,
fined, tarred, and feathered him, put a rope about
his neck, and plunged him into the sea; but he escaped
with life, though he was about seventy years of age.</p>

<p>In 1750 an episcopal clergyman, born and educated
in England, who had been in holy orders above twenty
years, once broke their sabbatical law by combing a discomposed
lock of hair on the top of his wig; at another
time, for making a humming noise, which they called
whistling; at a third time, by walking too fast from
church; at a fourth, by running into church when it
rained; at a fifth, by walking in his garden and picking
a bunch of grapes: for which several crimes he was
complained of by the Grand Jury, had warrants granted
against him, was seized, brought to trial, and paid a considerable
sum of money. At last, overwhelmed with
persecution and vexation, he cried out: “No Briton,
nay, no Jew, should assume any public character in
Connecticut till he has served an apprenticeship of
ten years in it; for I have been here seven years, and
strictly observed the Jewish law concerning the Sabbath,
yet find myself remiss in respect to the perfect
law of liberty!”</p>

<p><!--214.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>
The people are extremely fond of strangers passing
through the colony, but very averse to foreigners
settling among them; which few have done without
ruin to their characters and fortunes, by detraction and
lawsuits, unless recommended as men of grace by some
known and revered republican protestant in Europe.
The following story may be amusing:</p>

<p>An English gentleman, during a short residence in
a certain town, had the good luck to receive some civilities
from the Deacon, Minister, and Justice. The Deacon
had a daughter, without beauty, but sensible and
rich. The Briton (for that was the name he went by),
having received a present from the West-Indies of some
pineapples and sweetmeats, sent his servant with part
of it to the Deacon’s daughter, to whom, at the same
time, he addressed a complimentary note, begging Miss
would accept the pineapples and sweetmeats, and wishing
he might be able to make her a better present. Miss, on
reading the note, was greatly alarmed, and exclaimed,
“Mamma, mamma! Mr. Briton has sent me a love-letter.”
The mother read the note and shewed it to the Deacon,
and, after due consideration, both agreed in pronouncing
it a love-letter. The lawyer, justice, and parson were
sent for, who in council weighed every word in the
note, together with the golden temptation which the
lady possessed, and were of opinion that the writer was
in love, and that the note was a love-letter, but worded
so carefully that the law could not punish Briton for
attempting to court Miss without having obtained her
parents’ consent. The parson wrung his hands, rolled
up his eyes, shrugged up his shoulders, groaned out his
hypocritical grief, and said, “Deacon, I hope you do not
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>
blame me for having been the innocent cause of your
knowing this imprudent and haughty Briton. There
is something very odd in all the Britons; but I thought
this man had some prudence and modesty however,
Deacon,” putting his hand on his breast, and bowing,
with a pale, deceitful face, “I shall in future shun all
Britons, for they are all strange creatures.” The lawyer
and justice made their apologies, and were sorry
that Briton did not consider the quality of the Deacon’s
daughter before he wrote the letter. Miss, all apprehension
and tears, at finding that no punishment could
reach Briton in the course of law, cried out to her
counsellors, “Who is Briton? Am I not the Deacon’s
daughter? What have I done, that he should take
such liberties with me? Is he not the natural son of
some priest, or foundling? Ought he not to be exposed
for his assurance to the Deacon’s daughter?”</p>

<p>Her words took effect. The council voted that they
would show their contempt of Briton by neglecting him
for the time to come. On his return home, the parson,
after many great signs of surprise, informed his wife of
the awful event which had happened by the imprudence
of Briton. She soon communicated the secret
to her sister-gossips, prudently cautioning them not to
report it as from her. But, not content with that, the
parson himself went among all his acquaintance, shaking
his head, and saying, “O sirs! have you heard of
the strange conduct of friend Briton—how he wrote a
love-letter, and sent it, with some pineapples, to the
Deacon’s daughter? My wife and I had a great
friendship for Briton, but cannot see him any more.”</p>

<p>Thus the affected parson told this important tale to
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>
every one except Briton, who, from his ignorance of the
story, conducted himself in his usual manner towards
his supposed friends, though he observed they had a
show of haste and business whenever he met with any
of them. Happily for Briton, he depended not on the
Deacon, minister, or colony, for his support. At last
a Scotchman heard of the evil tale, and generously told
Briton of it, adding that the parson was supposed to be
in deep decline merely from grief and fatigue he had
endured in spreading it. Briton thanked the Scotchman,
and called on the friendly parson to know the
particulars of his offence. The parson, with sighs,
bows, and solemn smirkings, answered, “Sir, the fact
is, you wrote a love-letter to the Deacon’s daughter
without asking her parents’ consent; which has given
great offence to that lady, and to all her acquaintance,
of whom I and my wife have the honour to be reckoned
a part.” Briton kept his temper. “So, then,”
said he, “I have offended you by my insolent note to the
Deacon’s daughter! I hope my sin is venial. Pray,
sir, have you seen my note?” “Yes,” replied the
parson, “to my grief and sorrow. I could not have
thought you so imprudent, had I not seen and found
the note to be your own handwriting.” “How long
have you known of this offence?” “Some months.”
“Why, sir, did you not seasonably admonish me for
this crime?” “I was so hurt and grieved, and my
friendship so great, I could not bear to tell you.”
Mr. Briton then told the parson that his friendship
was so fine and subtle, it was invisible to an English
eye; and the Gospel ministers in England did not prove
their friendship by telling calumnious stories to everybody
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
but the person concerned. “But I suppose,”
added he, “this is genuine New-England friendship,
and merits thanks more than a supple-jack.” The
parson, with a leering look, sneaked away towards his
wife; and Briton left the colony without any civil or
ecclesiastical punishment, telling the Scotchman that
the Deacon’s daughter had money, and the parson faith
without eyes, or he should never have been accused of
making love to one who was naturally so great an
enemy to Cupid. Of such or worse sort being the reception
foreign settlers may expect from the inhabitants
of Connecticut, it is no wonder that few, or none, choose
to venture among them.</p>

<p>The custom of settling and dismissing a sober dissenting
minister is very singular. All the parishioners
meet and vote to apply to the Association for a candidate,
and one is accordingly sent. If he pleases, the
people vote to give him a call; if he accepts the call,
the actual communicants, and they alone, make the
covenant between him and them as Christ’s Church,
and thus they are married to him. After the candidate
is ordained, others, by acknowledging and swearing to
support the covenant, become married to him also.
(N. B. Baptism is not sufficient to take them out of
their natural state.) The call is an invitation from the
parishioners to the candidate to take upon him the ministerial
office of their Church, on condition that he be
allowed 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> or 400<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> settlement, and perhaps 100<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
salary, besides wood, &amp;c. &amp;c. during his residence
among them in that capacity. The candidate, after
looking round him and finding no better terms offered
from any other parish, answers in this manner: “Brethren
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>
and friends, I have considered your call, and, after
many fastings and prayers, I find it to be the call of
God, and close with your offer.” The Church then
appoints a day for his ordination, and the ministers who
shall assist in the ceremony, which is as follows:</p>

<p>1. The meeting is opened with a hymn. 2. Some
one makes a prayer. 3. Another hymn succeeds. 4.
A sermon. 5. Another prayer. 6. The covenant is
read. 7. The prayer of consecration, with imposition
of hands by the minister. 8. The right hand of fellowship,
which conveys that half of ministerial power
which I have already spoken of as communicated by
the Churches. 9. The charge—that is, to behave well
in the office whereto God has called him. 10. Prayer.
11. Another hymn. 12. The young minister dismisses
with his benediction. Numerous as the ceremonies are
in a minister’s ordination, there are but few judged
necessary in dismissing him; a majority of the Church
is enough to turn the minister from bed and board, or,
in their language, “to divorce him”—which happens
more frequently than is decent. The minister has no
remedy but in appealing to the Association, which step
entitles him to his salary till dismissed by that powerful
body. Incontinency, intemperance, lying, and idleness,
are the common accusations brought against the minister,
but seldom founded in truth, and yet always proved
by knights of the post. However, the minister carries
off his settlement in case he is dismissed for immoralities,
but not if he turns Churchman; then his old parishioners
are mean enough to sue for the settlement. A
recent instance of this kind happened at New-London,
where the minister, Doctor Mather Byles, desired a dismission,
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>
which was given him; but, finding the Doctor’s
design was to become a Churchman, the people
demanded the settlement given him twelve years before.
The Doctor, with a spirit worthy of himself and his
venerable ancestors, returned the money, with, “You
are welcome to it, since it proves to the world that
you could not accuse me of anything more agreeable
to ungenerous minds.”</p>

<p>The manner of visiting the sick in this province is
more terrible than charitable. The minister demands of
the sick if he be converted, when, and where. If the
answer is conformable to the system of the minister, it
is very well; if not, the sick is given over as a non-elect,
and no object of prayer. Another minister is then sent
for, who asks if the sick be willing to die—if he hates
God—if he be willing to be damned, if it please God to
damn him? Should he answer No, this minister quits
him, as the former. Finally, the sick man dies, and so
falls out of their hands into better.</p>

<p>Amidst all the darkness of superstition that surrounds
the State, the humanity it shows to poor strangers
seized with sickness in the colony, or to such persons
as are shipwrecked upon its coasts, shines with
distinguished lustre. These unfortunate sufferers are
immediately provided with the necessaries of every kind,
by order of the selectmen, whose expenses are reimbursed
out of the colony Treasury.</p>

<p>Thus is laudably employed a part of the money allowed
for contingencies; but another part is consumed
in a very different manner. It frequently happens
that, whenever the episcopalians become so numerous
in a parish as to gain the ascendency over the <span class="title">Sober</span>
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>
<span class="title">Dissenters</span>, and the latter cannot, by their own strength,
either destroy the episcopal or support their own Church,
the Governor and Council, with the advice of the Consociation,
kindly relieve them with an annual grant
out of the public Treasury, sometimes to the amount
of the whole sum paid into it by every denomination
of the parish. An act of charity of this kind lately
took place at Chelsea, in Norwich, where the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>
were few and poor, and without a meeting-house
or minister, so that they were obliged to walk a mile
to a meeting, or go to church. The young people chose
the latter, which alarmed the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> to such
a degree that they applied for and obtained from the
generous Governor and his virtuous Council 300<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per
annum out of the Treasury, besides the duties on the
vessels of the Churchmen of that port. This largition
enabled them to build a meeting-house and settle a minister.
When the Churchmen complained of this abuse
of the public money, the Governor answered, “The
Assembly has the same right to support christianity
as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts, or the Parliament of Great Britain.”</p>

<p>The murmurs of the people on the collection of the
revenue bespeak embezzlements of another kind. It
should seem that they believed the General Assembly
to be in the same predicament as the devil thought Job
was, when he said, “Doth Job serve God for nought?”</p>

<p>Estates in Connecticut pass from generation to generation
by gavelkind; so that there are few persons,
except of the labouring class, who have not freeholds of
their own to cultivate. A general mediocrity of station
being thus constitutionally promoted, it is no wonder
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>
that the rich man is despised, and the poor man’s blessing
is his poverty. In no part of the world are <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les
petits</span> and <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les grands</span> so much upon a par as here, where
none of the people are destitute of the conveniences of
life and the spirit of independence. From infancy,
their education as citizens points out no distinction between
licentiousness and liberty; and their religion is
so muffled with superstition, self-love, and provincial
enmity, as not yet to have taught them that humanity
and respect for others which from others they demand.
Notwithstanding these effects of the levelling plan,
there are many exceptions to be found in the province
of gentlemen of large estates and generous principles.</p>

<p>The people commonly travel on horseback, and the
ladies are capable of teaching their neighbours the art of
horsemanship. There are few coaches in the colony,
but many chaises and whiskeys. In winter the sleigh
is used—a vehicle drawn by two horses, and carrying
six persons in its box, which hangs on four posts standing
on two steel slides or large skates.</p>

<p>Dancing, fishing, hunting, skating, and riding in
sleighs on the ice, are all the amusements allowed in
this colony.</p>

<p>Smuggling is rivetted in the constitution and practice
of the inhabitants of Connecticut, as much as superstition
and religion, and their province is a storehouse for
the smugglers of the neighbouring colonies. They conscientiously
study to cheat the King of those duties
which, they say, God and Nature never intended should
be paid. From the Governor down to the tithing-man,
who are sworn to support the laws, they will aid smugglers,
resist collectors, and mob informers. This being
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>
a popular Government, all the officers are appointed by
the freeholders. There are very severe laws against
bribery. The candidates are not suffered to give a dinner,
or a glass of cider, on the day of the election, to a
voter. Indeed, bribery is the next greatest crime to a
breach of the Sabbath; yet open bribery, as established
by custom immemorial in Rhode-Island, is more praiseworthy
than the practice of Connecticut. I will give
the reader some idea of the mode in which an election
is managed in Connecticut.</p>

<p>All the voters in a township convene in the town
meeting-house. One of the ministers, after prayers,
preaches from some such text as, “Jabez was more
honourable than his brethren.” The people keep their
seats, while the constables take their votes in a box;
and if a voter has not his vote written, the constable
gives him one. So Jabez is elected; and the meeting
is concluded with a prayer of thanks to the Lord God
of Israel for “turning the hearts of his people against
the enemies of Zion, and for uniting them in Jabez,
the man after his own heart.” The manner in which
the preacher treats his text will more particularly appear
from the animadversion of a certain Quaker on one of
these occasions. “Friend,” said he to the pedagogue,
“I do thee no wrong in telling thee that thou hast prayed
and preached against bribery, but forgot to keep thy
tongue from speaking evil against thy neighbour.
Dost thou think the Lord will regard thy preaching
so much as the voters whom thou dost call freemen?
If thou believest it, thou hast bribed not only the people,
but the Lord also, to reject Ebenezer and Benjamin.”
The preacher called upon the constable to
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>
take away this babbler and open the meeting; which
was done, and Ebenezer and Benjamin were rejected by
the voters.</p>

<p>The men in general throughout the province are
tall, stout, and robust. The greatest care is taken of
the limbs and bodies of infants, which are kept straight
by means of a board—a practice learnt from the Indian
women, who abhor all crooked people—so that deformity
is here a rarity.</p>

<p>Another custom derived from the Indians is, to welcome
a new-born infant into the world with urine and
honey, the effects of which are wonderful; and hence
it is that at groanings there are always a little hog and
a rattle-snake’s skin, the latter of which prevents numbness
and the cramp. The women are fair, handsome,
genteel. They have, indeed, adopted various customs
of the Indian women, but cannot learn, like them, how
to support the pains of child-bearing without a groan.
Naturalists and surgeons have not been able to assign
the reason why a negro woman should have a hundred
pains, a white woman ten, and an Indian none. Some
have said that the fatigues and hardships which negroes
endure are the cause; but the Indians undergo many
more: others have said it was owing to the change of
climate; but this is suppletory: while the enthusiastic
divines attribute it to the sin of Eve, and to the curse
laid on the Canaanites. The deists ask these divines
if Eve was not the common mother of the white, black,
and copper-coloured women, and how it appears that
negroes are the descendants of Canaan? Their answer
is, that all Nature is mystery.</p>

<p>The women of Connecticut are strictly virtuous, and
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>
to be compared to the prude rather than the European
polite lady. They are not permitted to read plays;
cannot converse about whist, quadrille, or operas, but
will freely talk upon the subject of history, geography,
and mathematics. They are great casuists and polemical
divines; and I have known not a few of them so well
skilled in Greek and Latin as often to put to the blush
learned gentlemen.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the modesty of the females is such
that it would be accounted the greatest rudeness for a
gentleman to speak, before a lady, of a garter, knee, or
leg, yet it is thought but a piece of civility to ask her
to bundle—a custom as old as the first settlement in
1634. It is certainly innocent, virtuous, and prudent,
or the puritans would not have permitted it to prevail
among their offspring, for whom, in general, they would
suffer crucifixion. Children brought up with the chastest
ideas, with so much religion as to believe that the
omniscient God sees them in the dark, and that angels
guard them when absent from their parents, will not—nay,
cannot—act a wicked thing. People who are influenced
more by lust than a serious faith in God, who is too
pure to behold iniquity with approbation, ought never
to bundle. If any man, thus a stranger to the love of
virtue, of God, and the christian religion, should bundle
with a young lady in New-England, and behave
himself unseemly towards her, he must first melt her
into passion, and expel heaven, death, and hell, from her
mind, or he will undergo the chastisement of negroes
turned mad; if he escapes with life, it will be owing to
the parents flying from their beds to protect him.</p>

<p>The Indians, who had this method of courtship when
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>
the English arrived among them in 1634, are the most
chaste set of people in the world.</p>

<p>Concubinage and fornication are vices none of them
are addicted to, except such as forsake the laws of Hobbomockow
and turn christians. The savages have taken
many female prisoners, carried them back three hundred
miles into their country, and kept them several
years, and yet not a single instance of their violating
the laws of chastity has ever been known. This cannot
be said of the French, or of the English, whenever Indian
or other women have fallen into their hands. I
am no advocate for temptation, yet must say that bundling
has prevailed 160 years in New-England, and, I
verily believe, with ten times more chastity than the
sitting on a sofa. About the year 1756, Boston, Salem,
Newport, and New York, resolving to be more polite
than their ancestors, forbade their daughters bundling
on the bed with any young man whatever, and introduced
a sofa, to render courtship more palatable and
Turkish. Whatever it was owing to, whether to the
sofa or any uncommon excess of the <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu d’esprit</span>, there
went abroad a report that the <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffinage</span> produced more
natural consequences than all the bundling among the
boors with their <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rurales pendantes</span> through every village
in New-England besides.</p>

<p>In 1766, a clergyman from one of the polite towns
went into the country and preached against the unchristian
custom of young men and maidens lying
together upon the same bed. He was no sooner out of
the Church, than attacked by a shoal of good old women,
with, “Sir, do you think we and our daughters are
naughty because we allow bundling?” “You lead
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>
yourselves into temptation by it.” They all replied at
once, “Sir, have you been told thus, or has experience
taught you?” The Levite began to lift his eyes and to
consider his situation, and, bowing, said, “I have been
told so.” The ladies, <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">una voce</span>, bawled out, “Your informants,
sir, we conclude, are those city ladies who
prefer a sofa to a bed. We advise you to alter your sermon
by substituting the word sofa for bundling, and,
on your return home, preach to them: for experience
has told us that city-folks send more children into the
country without father and mother to own them, than
are born among us; therefore, you see, a sofa is more
dangerous than a bed.” The poor priest, seemingly
convinced of his blunder, exclaimed, “<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec vitia nostra,
nec remedia pati possumus</span>,” hoping hereby to get rid
of his guests; but an old matron pulled off her spectacles,
and, looking the priest in the face like a Roman
heroine, said, “<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noli putare me hæc auribus tuis dares</span>.”
Others cried out to the priest to explain his Latin.
“The English,” he said, “is this: Woe to me that I
sojourn in Meseck, and dwell in the tents of Kedar!”
One pertly replied, “<span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladii decussati sunt gemina
presbytericalvis</span>.” The priest confessed his error,
begged pardon, and promised never more to preach
against bundling, or to think amiss of the custom; the
ladies generously forgave him, and went away.</p>

<p>It may seem very strange to find this custom of
bundling in bed attended with so much innocence in
New-England, while in Europe it is thought not safe,
or scarcely decent, to permit a young man or maid to be
together in private anywhere. But, in this quarter of
the Old World, the viciousness of the one and the simplicity
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>
of the other are the result merely of education
and habit. It seems to be a part of heroism, among the
polished nations of it, to sacrifice the virtuous fair one
whenever an opportunity offers, and thence it is concluded
that the same principles actuate those of the New
World. It is egregiously absurd to judge of all countries
by one. In Spain, Portugal, and Italy, jealousy
reigns; in France, England, and Holland, suspicion; in
the West and East-Indies, lust; in New-England, superstition.
These four blind deities govern Jews, Turks,
christians, infidels, and heathen. Superstition is the
most amiable. She sees no vice with approbation, but
persecution, and self-preservation is the cause of her
seeing that. My insular readers will, I hope, believe
me, when I tell them that I have seen in the West-Indies
naked boys and girls, some fifteen or sixteen years
of age, waiting at table and at tea, even when twenty
or thirty virtuous English ladies were in the room; who
were under no more embarrassment at such an awful
sight in the eyes of English people who have not travelled
abroad, than they would have been at the sight of
so many servants in livery. Shall we censure the ladies
of the West-Indies as vicious above their sex on account
of this local custom? By no means; for long experience
has taught the world that the West-Indian white
ladies are virtuous prudes. Where superstition reigns,
fanaticism will be minister of state; and the people,
under the taxation of zeal, will shun what is commonly
called vice with ten times more care than the polite and
civilized christians who know what is right and what is
wrong from reason and revelation. Happy would it be
for the world, if reason and revelation were suffered to
<!--228.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>
control the minds and passions of the great and wise
men of the world, as superstition does that of the simple
and less polished! When America shall elect societies
for the promotion of chastity in Europe, in return
for the establishment of European arts in American
capitals, then Europe will discover that there is more
christian philosophy in American bundling than can be
found in the customs of nations more polite.</p>

<p>I should not have said so much about bundling had
not a learned divine (Dr. Burnaby) of the English
Church published his Travels through some parts of
America, wherein this remarkable custom is represented
in an unfavourable light, and as prevailing among the
lower class of people. The truth is, the custom prevails
among all classes, to the great honour of the country,
its religion, and ladies. The virtuous may be
tempted; but the tempter is despised. Why it should
be thought incredible for a young man and young
woman innocently and virtuously to lie down together
in a bed with a great part of their clothes on, I cannot
conceive. Human passions may be alike in every
region; but religion, diversified as it is, operates differently
in different countries. Upon the whole, had I
daughters now, I would venture to let them bundle upon
the bed, or even on the sofa, after a proper education,
sooner than adopt the Spanish mode of forcing young
people to prattle only before the lady’s mother the chit-chat
of artless lovers. Could the four quarters of the
world produce a more chaste, exemplary, and beautiful
company of wives and daughters than are in Connecticut,
I should not have remaining one favourable sentiment
for the province. But the soil, the rivers, the
<!--229.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>
ponds, the ten thousand landscapes, together with the
virtuous and lovely women which now adorn the ancient
kingdoms of Connecticut, Sassacus, and Quinnipiog,
would tempt me into the highest wonder and admiration
of them, could they once be freed of the skunk, the
moping-owl, rattle-snake, and fanatic christian.</p>

<p>My readers will naturally be desirous of information
in what manner the people of Connecticut conduct themselves
in regard to the Stamp Act, which has proved the
subject of so much speculation and controversy both in
America and Europe. I will, therefore, give a particular
account of their proceedings concerning it, which
will, perhaps, appear to have been of far greater consequence
than is generally supposed in England.</p>

<p>The American colonists were no sooner extricated
from all danger of Gallic depredations by the peace of
1763, than they began to manifest symptoms of ingratitude
and rebellion against their deliverers. Connecticut,
on several accounts, particularly that of its free constitution
in Church and State, which prevented every interruption
from a King’s Governor, was fixed upon as
the fittest site for raising the first-fruits of jealousies
and disaffection. Nor did the hatred which kept the
province at eternal strife within itself on all other
occasions, prevent its political coincidence upon this.
In 1764, delegates from every dissenting association in
America convened at Newhaven and settled the plan of
operations. They voted that the American Vine was
endangered by the encroachment of the English Parliament
and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
in Foreign Parts; that episcopacy was established in
Nova-Scotia, and missionaries maintained by the English
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>
Government, while New-England and other American
States were taxed to support that same Government;
that a league and covenant ought to be made and signed
by all good protestants against the machinations of their
enemies, and in defence of their civil and religious
liberties; that it was the duty of all good protestants to
stand upon their guard, and collect and send every kind
of interesting intelligence to the Moderator at Hertford,
whose business would be to communicate the same in
his circular letters to the true friends of protestant
liberty. In my opinion, whoever does not perceive the
spirit of civil as well as religious independence in this
convention, and these resolutions of dissenting divines,
must be politically blind. Whilst Mr. Grenville was
exerting his fanatical faculties for the relief of the
Mother Country; ready to sink under the load of expense
brought upon her by that war which had opened an
avenue to highest exaltation for her American offspring,
Connecticut was early advertised by merchants, divines,
and ladies, in England, that the Parliament was
about to give the colonies a specimen of English burthens.
The Consociation ordered a fast, to deprecate the
threatened judgments. This fast was served up with
sermons pointing out the reigns of wicked kings, lords,
and bishops, in the last century; and concluded with,
“One woe is past, and, behold, there come two woes
more hereafter!”</p>

<p>A requisition having been made, in 1763, that each
colony in America should raise a revenue to assist Great
Britain in discharging the national debt, which had been
partly incurred at their request and for their preservation,
the General Assembly was instructed by Dr. Franklin
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>
and others how to act. Accordingly, the Assembly
resolved not to raise any money towards the national
debt, or any national expenses, till the Parliament should
remove the Navigation Act, which, they said, was advantageous
to Great Britain and disadvantageous to America;
and, therefore, Great Britain, in defraying the whole
of the national expense, did nothing more than justice
required, so long as that act should be continued. Such
were the arguments and resolutions of the General Assembly,
although their agent in England had informed
them that, if they refused to comply with the requisition
of the minister, the Parliament would tax them.</p>

<p>The agent’s intelligence proved to be well founded.
In 1765 the Stamp Act passed, because the colonies had
refused to tax themselves. News so important soon
arrived in America, and the Consociation of Connecticut
appointed another fast, and ordered the angels to
sound their trumpets, and great plagues followed.
Thomas Fitch, the Governor, shewed some dislike to
the proceedings of the Consociation, but was given to
understand that Christ’s ministers acted by an authority
superior to that of the Governor or a king. The episcopalians,
and many sects, saw no reason for keeping the
fast; but the Governor observed it with a view of
securing his election the next year, and was successful.
The episcopalians were rewarded for their disobedience
with what is called “a new religious comic Liturgy,”
which was printed and circulated through the colony as
the performance of Doctor Franklin, and acted in many
towns by the young people on evenings by way of sport
and amusement. The litany was altered in many places,
especially in the paragraphs respecting the King, nobility,
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span>
&amp;c.; and instead of “We beseech thee to hear us,
good Lord!” was substituted, “We beseech thee, O
Cromwell, to hear (our prayers) us.” “O holy, blessed,
and glorious Trinity!” was altered thus, “O Chatham,
Wilkes, and Franklin, have mercy upon us!” “From
plague, pestilence, famine,” &amp;c. was followed by “O
Cromwell, deliver us!” An episcopal clergyman had
courage enough to complain of these blasphemous proceedings,
and the Grand Jury indicted the comic actors;
but the magistrate to whom the complaint was made
refused to grant a warrant, using worse maledictions
against the King than were contained in the ludicrous
litany. Hereupon the Grand Jury indicted the magistrate
for high treason; but no magistrate could be found
of resolution enough to grant a warrant against the
traitor. However, the comic liturgy was acted but privately
afterwards, and, upon the repeal of the Stamp
Act, was suppressed as far as they could do it.</p>

<p>This second fast was sanctified with preaching on
this and similar texts, “And there arose a new king in
Egypt who remembered not Joseph,” and with praying
God to grant the King a heart of flesh, and to remove
popery out of the British Parliament.</p>

<p>The Stamp Act was to take place in November, 1765;
some months before which the stamp-master, Jared Ingersoll,
Esq. who had been the colony’s agent in England,
arrived at Newhaven in Connecticut. In September
a special Assembly was convened at Hertford, for
the purpose of considering what steps to take. As if
to avoid the supremacy of the British Parliament, they
determined not to apply themselves for the repeal of
the act, but secretly encouraged a number of lawyers,
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>
merchants, and divines to meet, by their own authority,
at New-York, for that purpose. In the mean time
three mobs were raised, under Durgy, Leach, and Parsons,
who by different routes marched into Newhaven
to seize the stamp-master. They succeeded; and, having
brought their prisoner before the Assembly-house
at Hertford, they gave him the alternative to resign or
die. Mr. Ingersoll appealed several times by confidential
messengers to the Assembly then sitting, but, finding
them inclined to countenance the mob, he was forced
to resign, and authenticate the same by whirling first
his hat, and next his wig, three times round his head,
and then into the air; whilst the General Assembly and
Consociation (which last venerable body never fails to
be ready with its counsel and assistance on all salutary
occasions) shouted with the multitude, from their windows,
at the glorious achievement.</p>

<p>This special Assembly, having sufficiently manifested
the part they wished the colony to take, broke up, leaving
further proceedings to the mob, who continued to
act up to the specimen already given, and the Congress
of New York, which met then accordingly, agreed
upon and transmitted to England a petition for a repeal
of the obnoxious act.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
</p>

<p><!--234.png--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>
The October session of the General Assembly is always
holden at Newhaven: there and then they were
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
informed by Mr. Dyer,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
who had made one of the petitioners
at New York, that it was recommended by
the Congress for the colonial governors to take the
oath prescribed by the Stamp Act.</p>

<p>The General Assembly, however, voted that the
Governor of Connecticut should not take it; and, moreover,
determined to continue Mr. Fitch in his office,
notwithstanding the disfranchisement incident on his
refusal, if he would be guided by their advice: the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Ebenezer Devotion, one of the Representatives,
and Eliphalet Dyer (above mentioned), one of the
Council, offered to pay the imposed fine of 1,000<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
However, the Governor presented himself before the
Council, whose business it was to administer the oath,
but which, it is thought, Mr. Fitch presumed would be
denied, and therefore artfully devised this means at
once of avoiding the oath and shifting the penalties
<!--236.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>
from himself upon them. Seven out of the twelve,
suspecting the Governor’s design, put their fingers in
their ears, shuffled their feet, and ran groaning out of
the house; the other five stayed, and administered the
oath, with a view to saving themselves and the Charter
and direct the wrath of the people against the Governor;
but in this they were mistaken, incurring in
common with him the odium of the patriots. The
Stamp Act having thus gained footing, the Assembly
broke up. Legal proceedings also were discontinued,
and the courts of justice shut. The Consociations and
Associations kept frequent fasts of their own appointment,
prayers, and preaching against Roman Catholic
rulers, Arminian governors, and false-hearted councillors
and episcopizing curates. Hereupon the mobs became
outrageous; sedition was law and rebellion gospel.
The stamp-master was called a traitor to his country,
and the episcopalians enemies to Zion and liberty.</p>

<p>The fastings, prayers, and riots brought about a
revolution in the colony. Fitch, who had taken, and
the five assistants who had administered, the oath, as
well as many officers, both civil and military, who declined
to take a rebellious part, were dismissed from
their posts; and a new Governor, other councillors, &amp;c.
were chosen, and the people fitted for every kind of
mischief—all, however, under the pretence of religion
and liberty. The patriotic Mr. Dyer distinguished
himself by furnishing the fasting ministers with proper
materials to inflame the minds of the people against the
just demands of the King. One of his Machiavellian
dogmas was, that the King claimed the colonies as his
patrimony, and intended to raise a revenue in each
<!--237.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
province; and that, having gained this point, his purpose
was to govern England by America and America
by England, and thereby subvert liberty and establish
tyranny in both, as the kings of France had done by
means of the various parliaments in that country. Mr.
Dyer declared he had this information from the best
authority in England, and added, that the liberties of
both countries depended on America resisting the Stamp
Act, even unto blood. These and such like reveries
supplied the ministers of the Gospel with a great body
of political divinity, and the mob with courage to
break Churchmen’s windows, and cry out, “No bishops!
no popery! no kings, lords, and tyrants!” Everything
but decency and order overran the colony. Indeed,
the General Assembly kept up their meetings,
but it was only to transact such business as was not
affected by the Stamp Act. The mobs of the fasting
ministers continued their lawless proceedings, without
further interruption and impediment than what they
met with from the strenuous exertions of the King’s
friends, who had repeatedly saved the lives of the
stamp-master, Governor Fitch, the five rejected councillors,
the episcopal clergy, and many good subjects, at
the hazard of their own, though they could not preserve
them from daily abuse and insult.</p>

<p>The mob, having been spirited up and trained to
violence and outrage for several months, began to make
some alarm even to the instigators, especially as they
were hitherto disappointed in their expectations of the
act being repealed. The Governor and Council, therefore,
directing their attention to the dangerous consequences
of the lawless state and refractory temper the
<!--238.png--><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>
people were in, and being struck with the foresight of
their own perilous situation, resolved, early in 1766, to
open the courts of law under the Stamp Act, if the very
next packet did not bring certain advices of its repeal;
and all parties who had causes depending in any court
were to be duly notified by the Governor’s proclamation.
This determination was no less mortifying to the
mob than gratifying to the King’s friends, who were
convinced that the Stamp Act ought, both in policy and
justice, to be enforced, and therefore had risked their
lives, fortunes, characters, and colonial honours in its
support. The patriots, now apparently sickened with
licentiousness, became very complaisant to the loyalists,
declaring that, in all their opposition to the Stamp
Act, they had meant nothing personal, and desiring to
have past animosities buried in oblivion. All things
thus settled, tranquillity seemed to be returning; when,
lo! the packet arrived with the fatal news of the repeal
of the Stamp Act. Then a double portion of madness
seized the patriots, who, in their excess of joy “that
victory was gained over the beast, and over his mark,”
utterly forgot their late penitential and tranquil professions,
branding the King’s friends with the appellations
of tories, Jacobites, and papists. The Gospel
ministers left off their fastings, and turned mourning
into joy and triumph. “Now we behold,” they said in
their pulpits, “that Great Britain is afraid of us; for
the Stamp Act is repealed, even upon the petition of an
illegal body of men. If, therefore, we stand fast in
the liberties wherein Christ has made us free, we need
not fear in future the usurpations of the kings, lords,
and bishops of England.” The accompanying claim
<!--239.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>
of Parliament to the power of binding America in all
cases whatsoever was, indeed, a thorn which galled them
much; but they found a salvo in ordering a copy of the
repeal to be burnt under the gallows by the common
hangman. The General Assembly also stepped forward,
and voted the populace several barrels of powder,
and puncheons of rum, together with 100<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> in
money, to celebrate the festival. A tremendous mob
met together at Hertford and received their present.
The powder was placed in a large brick school, and
the rum on the common square. While each one
was contending for his share, the powder took fire
and blew up the school, killing fifteen or sixteen
persons, and wounding many. This disaster shook the
house where the Consociation was sitting; upon which
they resolved that Heaven did not approve of their rejoicings
because the repeal was but partial! They
therefore ordered a new fast, to do away the iniquities
of that day, and to implore the Supreme to direct them
in what manner to guard against the machinations of
“the locusts who had a king over them, whose name in
the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek
Apollyon!”</p>

<p>This fast was cooked up with a favourite text in
New-England, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “He reproved even kings for their
sake.” From these words the preachers proved that
the King’s power lay in his mouth, and in his tail,
which, like “a serpent, did hurt for a month and a
year;” and that God would protect his people against
“the murderers, the sorceries, the fornication, the thefts”
of bishops, popes, and kings, “and make nations angry,
and give them power to judge and destroy those who
<!--240.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>
would destroy his prophets and his saints.” In this
day of great humiliation the prophets entertained the
saints with a spice of rejoicing, because “victory was
gotten over the beast, and over his image, and over his
mark, and over the number of his name.” “Therefore,”
said they, “rejoice, O inhabitants of the earth
and of the sea, because we can get, buy, and sell, without
the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number
of his name.”</p>

<p>This bombastic declamation against the authority of
Great Britain raised the passions of a great portion of
this multitude higher than was intended. They had
lately been tutored to form high notions of their own
consequence, had been intoxicated with a life of confusion
in a lawless country, and had now no relish for
a government of any kind whatever; accordingly, inflamed
by the rhapsodies of the preachers, they set themselves
against that of the colony; arguing that if the
Lord would reprove kings, lords, and bishops, for their
sake, he would also reprove governors, magistrates, and
consociations, for their sakes.</p>

<p>This revolt of a part of the people was encouraged
and strengthened by the adherents of Governor Fitch,
the five discarded councillors, and the loyalists; so that
very formidable bodies soon appeared in divers towns,
threatening destruction to the General Assembly, Consociation,
Associations, executive courts, &amp;c. &amp;c. Colonel
Street Hall, of Wallingford, a loyalist, was appointed
governor over these supreme multitudes. They
soon acquainted the General Assembly and Consociation
that, by the authority that England had been reformed,
by the same authority should Connecticut be
<!--241.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>
reformed; and Mr. Hall sent a letter to the Judges of
the County Court, then sitting at Newhaven, purporting
that it was not agreeable to the people for them to
continue their proceedings, or that any executions
should be granted, and concluding thus: “Ye that have
ears to hear, hear what is said unto you; for we shall
quickly come.” The judges, without hesitation or
adjournment, ran out of court and went home as privately
as possible. The merchants, the Gospel ministers,
the lawyers, and judges, who had with great zeal
inculcated the divine right of the people to resist kings,
found themselves in a starving condition under the exercise
of their boasted right. The General Assembly
and Association, however, again convened, and, after
much fasting and prayer, resolved that the conduct of
Street Hall, Esq. and his associates, was seditious and
treasonable; and ordered the Attorney-General, Colonel
Elihu Hall, to indict his nephew, Street Hall, for treasonable
practices. The Attorney-General refused to
comply with this mandate, whereupon he was dismissed,
and James Hillhouse, Esq. appointed in his
place, who indicted Street Hall; but no sheriff dared
serve the warrant. Street Hall ordered his people to
prepare for battle and to be ready at a minute’s warning,
and rode about with one servant, in defiance of the
General Assembly, who likewise prepared to support
their power. It is most likely that Street Hall would
have prevailed had an engagement taken place; for the
episcopalians, and all the friends of Mr. Fitch and the
five dismissed councillors, would have supported Mr.
Hall. But a battle was prevented by the interposition
of the Consociation, with this curious Gospel axiom,
<!--242.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that it was legal and politic in the people to oppose
and resist the foreign power which was unjustly
claimed by the King of Great Britain; but it was
neither politic nor right to oppose the magistrates and
laws made by themselves. They prevailed on Street
Hall to condescend to write to the General Assembly to
this effect: “That he was a friend to the laws and constitution
of the colony, and wished to support both;
and should do it, on condition that they would rescind
their vote, and that no one should be prosecuted for
what had been done by him and his associates.” The
Assembly very gladly voted this overture of Street
Hall to be satisfactory; and thus peace was re-established
between the Assembly and Street Hall. Nevertheless,
Mr. Hall was greatly censured by his partisans
for this compromise; and he lived in constant expectation
of their hanging him, till he softened them by
this remarkable address in vindication of his conduct:
“We have done,” said he, “everything in our power to
support the authority of the British Parliament over
the colonies. We have lost our property, local reputations,
and all colonial offices and respect among our
countrymen, in defence of that King and Parliament
who have not shed a tear for our sufferings, nor failed
to sacrifice their own dignities and their best friends
to please a party that never will be easy until another
Oliver arise and extirpate kings, lords, and bishops.
By heavens!” added Street Hall, with great energy,
“I will rest my life upon this single question, Who
would stand up in defence of a king who prefers his
enemies to his friends? If you acquit me, I shall
more fully declare my principles.”</p>

<p><!--243.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
The mob, after much consideration, declared their
approbation of Mr. Hall’s conduct; upon which he
resumed his address nearly as follows:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we have once been betrayed and
forsaken by the King and Parliament of Great
Britain; no dependence, then, ought henceforth to
be placed upon either. It is plain to me, that if
we had extirpated the General Assembly and all
the avowed enemies of the constitution of Great
Britain, yet that very Parliament would have been
the first of all the creation to honour us with a gallows
for our reward. I therefore swear by Him who
controls the wheels of time, that in future I will support
the laws and dignity of the colony, and never
more put any confidence in princes or British Parliament.
The Saviour of the world trusted Judas but
once; and it is my opinion that those who betray and
forsake their friends ought to experience the wrath
and indignation of friends turned enemies. In this
case, baseness is policy, ingratitude loyalty, and revenge
heroic virtue!”</p>

<p>Colonel Street Hall spoke with great vehemence,
and might be censured for rashness by people who were
not in America at the time; but his sentiments reached
the hearts of half of the King’s friends there; for the
repeal of the Stamp Act had fixed in their breasts an
everlasting hatred to the fickle temper of Britons.</p>

<p>Few people, hereafter, will advance a sixpence in
support of any acts of the Parliament of Great Britain
over her colonies. Prior to the year 1766 such a public
spirit prevailed in America over private interest as
would naturally have led the people to conform to any
<!--244.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>
acts of the British Parliament, from a deep-rooted confidence
that the requisitions of Britain would be no
other than the requisitions of wisdom and necessity.
Two-thirds, I may say with safety, of all the people in
America thought there was wisdom and justice in the
Stamp Act, and wished to have it continued: first, because
they were sensible of being greatly indebted to
the generosity and protection of Britain; secondly, because
they had rather be subject to the control of Parliament
in regard to a revenue, than have it raised by the
authority of their own Assemblies, who favour the rich
and oppress the poor; and thirdly, because the Stamp
Act would have prevented innumerable suits at law, the
costs of which, in Connecticut, have during the last forty
years amounted to ten times as much as all others for
war, gospel, physic, the poor, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is impossible
to describe the disappointment and mortification they
suffered by the repeal of that act; it exposed them to calumny,
derision, and oppression; it disheartened all, and
occasioned the defection of many, while their adversaries
triumphed in the encouragement it had given them to
prosecute their malicious schemes against the Church,
King, laws, and commerce of England. However, in
regard to the question of raising a revenue in America,
I have never met with one American who would not
allow (though unwillingly) the reasonableness of it, with
certain conditions and provisos.</p>

<p>Thus: 1. The judges and lawyers required the tax
to be imposed by the General Assembly of each province.
2. The merchants, whose conscience is gain, and
who commonly constitute more than half of the Assembly,
declared that, before any revenue was raised, the
<!--245.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
Navigation Act should be repealed, and the East India
Company, and all the monopolies, dissolved. 3. The
Gospel ministers, whose power in New-England is terrible
to flesh and spirit, would contribute to a revenue
after the King and Parliament had dropped their claim
to supreme authority over America, and secured the
American Vine against the domination and usurpations
of bishops. To these sources may be traced all the objections
made against a revenue in America, which
sprung from three orders of men of the least real benefit
to the country, and whose proportion to all others
there is not one to a hundred; though they have had
the art and address, by imposition and delusion, to involve
them in their tumultuous contentions and ruinous
projects and undertakings. Indeed, the clergy, lawyers,
and merchants of European countries have been represented
as the worst enemies of society—the great promoters
of discord, war, insurrections, and rebellions; but
the heathen have not yet given us an example how
depraved mankind would be without them. However,
supposing the crimination to have foundation, there is
one good reason to be offered in palliation of it. Most
governments are too apt to adopt the maxim of rewarding
prosperous opposing zealots, whilst the exertions
of oppressed friends are passed over, if not with contempt
at least with silent neglect. Hence, men will
naturally be induced, in defiance of law and gospel, to
head parties, to become consequential in the world.</p>

 About two years after, he made a second voyage to the river, in the
service of a number of Dutch merchants; and, some time after, made sale
of his right to the Dutch. The right to the country, however, was antecedently
in King James, by virtue of discovery which Hudson had made
under his commission. The English protested against this sale; but the
Dutch, in 1614, under the Amsterdam West India Company, built a fort,
nearly on the same grounds where the city of Albany now is, which they
called Fort Aurania. Sir Thomas Dale, Governor of Virginia, directly
after dispatched Captain Argall to dispossess the Dutch, and they submitted
to the King of England, and under him to the Governor of Virginia.</p>

 November 3, 1620, just before the arrival of Mr. Robinson’s people
in New England, King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, by letters-patent, under the great seal
of England, incorporated the Duke of Lenox, the Marquises of Rockingham
and Hamilton, the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, and others, to
the number of forty noblemen, knights, and gentlemen, by the name of
“the Council established at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, for the

<p> <a name="footnote_6" id="footnote_6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_6"><span class="muchsmaller">[6]</span></a>
 Nearly at the same time, October 8, 1635, Mr. John Winthrop, son
of Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts, arrived at Boston with a commission
from Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook, and other noblemen and
gentlemen interested in the Connecticut patent, to erect a fort at the
mouth of the Connecticut River. Their lordships sent over men, ordnance,
ammunition, and two thousand pounds sterling, for the accomplishment
of their design.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop was directed by his commission, immediately on his arrival,
to repair to Connecticut with fifty able men, and to erect the fortifications
and to build houses for the garrison, and for gentlemen who
might come over into Connecticut. They were first to build houses for
their own present accommodation, and after that such as should be suitable
for the reception of men of quality. The latter were to be erected
within the fort.</p>

<p>It was required that the planters at the beginning should settle themselves
near the mouth of the river, and set down in bodies, that they
might be in a situation for intrenching and defending themselves. The
commission made provision for the reservation of a thousand or fifteen
hundred acres of good land for the maintenance of the fort, as nearly
adjoining it as might be with convenience.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop, having intelligence that the Dutch were preparing to
take possession of the mouth of the river, as soon as he could engage
twenty men and furnish them with provisions, dispatched them in a
small vessel of about thirty tons, to prevent their getting command
of the river, and to accomplish the service to which he had been appointed.</p>

<p>But a few days after the party sent by Mr. Winthrop arrived at the
mouth of the river, a Dutch vessel appeared off the harbor from New
Netherlands, sent on purpose to take possession of the mouth of the
river and to erect fortifications. The English had by this time mounted
two pieces of cannon and prevented their landing; thus, providentially,
was this fine tract of country preserved for our venerable ancestors and
their posterity.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop was appointed Governor of the Connecticut River and
the ports adjacent for the term of one year. He erected a fort, built
houses, and made a settlement, according to his instructions. One David
Gardiner, an expert engineer, assisted in the work, planned the fortifications,
and was appointed lieutenant of the fort.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport and others, who afterward settled New Haven, were
active in this affair, and hired Gardiner, in behalf of their lordships, to
come to New England and assist in this business.</p>

<p>As the settlement of the three towns on Connecticut River was begun
before the arrival of Mr. Winthrop, and the design of their lordships to
make plantations upon it was known, it was agreed that the settlers on
the river should either remove upon full satisfaction being made by their
lordships, or else sufficient room should be found for them and their
companions at some other place.</p>

<p>While these plantations were forming in the southwestern part of
Connecticut, another commenced on the west side of the mouth of the
Connecticut River. A fort had been built here in 1635-’36, and preparations
had been made for the reception of gentlemen of quality; but the
war with the Pequots, the uncultivated state of the country, and the low
condition of the colony, prevented the coming of any principal character
from England to take possession of a township and make settlement in
this tract.</p>

<p>Until this time there had been only a garrison of about twenty men
in the place. They had made some small improvements in the lands, and
erected a few buildings in the vicinity of the fort; but there had been no
settlement of a plantation with civil privileges. But about midsummer
Mr. George Fenwick, with his lady and family, arrived in a ship of two
hundred and fifty tons; another ship came in company with him. They
were both for Qunnipiack.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenwick and others came over with the view to take possession
of a large tract upon the river in behalf of their lordships, the original
patentees, and to plant a town at the mouth of the river. A settlement
was soon made, and named Saybrook, in honor of their lordships, Say
and Seal, and Brook.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Thomas Peters, who was the first minister in the
plantation, Captain Gardiner, Thomas Leffingwell, Thomas Tracy, and
Captain John Mason, were some of the principal planters.</p>

<p> <a name="footnote_7" id="footnote_7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_7"><span class="muchsmaller">[7]</span></a>
 In July, 1638, Mr. Winslow and Mr. Bradford, therefore, made a journey
to Boston to confer with Governor Winthrop and his Council on the
subject. Governor Winslow and Mr. Bradford proposed to them to join
with Plymouth in a trade to Connecticut for hemp and beaver, and to
erect a house for the purpose of commerce. It was represented as necessary
to prevent the Dutch from taking possession of that fine country,
who, it was reported, were about to build upon the river. But Governor
Winthrop declined the motion; he considered it was not proper to make
a plantation there, because there were three or four thousand warlike
Indians upon the river, and small pinnaces only could enter at high water;
also, because that seven months in the year no vessels could go into it,
by reason of the ice and the violence of the stream.</p>

<p>The Plymouth people, therefore, determined to undertake the enterprise
at their own risk. Preparations were made for erecting a trading-house
and establishing a small company on the river. In the mean time,
the master of a vessel from Massachusetts, who was trading at New
Netherlands, showed to Walter Van Twiller, the Dutch Governor, the
commission which the English had to trade and settle in New England,
and that his Majesty the King of England had granted all these parts to
his own subjects. He, therefore, desired that the Dutch would not build
at Connecticut.</p>

<p>This appears to have been done at the direction of Governor Winthrop,
for, in consequence of it, the Dutch Governor wrote a very complaisant
letter to him, in which he represented that the lords, the States-General,
had granted the same country to the West India Company. He
requested, therefore that the English would make no settlements in Connecticut
until the affair should be determined between the court of England
and the States-General.</p>

<p>This appears to have been a piece of policy in the Dutch Governor to
keep the English still until the Dutch had got a firm footing upon the river.</p>

<p>Several vessels this year went to Connecticut River to trade. John
Oldham, from Dorchester, and three men with him, also traveled through
the wilderness to Connecticut, to view the country and trade with the
Indians. The sachem upon the river made him most welcome, and gave
him a present in beaver. He found that the Indian hemp grew spontaneously
in the meadows in great abundance. He purchased a quantity
of it, and upon trial it appeared much to exceed the hemp which was
grown in England.</p>

<p>William Holmes, of Portsmouth, with his company, having prepared
the frame of a house, with boards, and materials for covering it immediately,
put them on board of a vessel and sailed for Connecticut. Holmes
had a commission from the Governor of Plymouth and a chosen company
to accomplish his design.</p>

<p>When he came into the river he found that the Dutch had got in before
him, made a light fort, and planted two pieces of cannon: this was
erected at the place called Hartford.</p>

<p>The Dutch forbade Holmes going up the river, stood by their cannon,
and ordered him to strike his colors or they would fire upon him; but he
was a man of spirit, assured them that he had a commission from the
Governor of Plymouth to go up the river, and that he must obey his orders.
They poured out their threats, but he proceeded, and, landing on the west
side of the river, erected his house a little below the mouth of the small
river in Windsor. The house was covered with the utmost dispatch, and
fortified with palisadoes. The sachems who were the original owners of
the soil had been driven from this part of the country by the Pequots,
and were now carried home on board of Holmes’s vessel. Of them the
Plymouth people purchased the land on which they erected their house.
“This,” Governor Wolcott says, “was the first house erected in Connecticut.”
The Dutch about the same time erected a trading-house at Hartford,
which they called the “Hirse of Good Hope.”</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that Holmes and his company erected and
fortified their house, and kept it afterward. The Indians were offended
at their bringing home the original proprietors and lords of the country,
and the Dutch that they had settled there, and were about to rival them
in trade and in possession of these excellent lands upon the river. They
were obliged, therefore, to combat both, and to keep a constant watch
upon them.</p>

<p>The Dutch, before the Plymouth people took possession of the river,
had invited them in an amicable manner to trade in Connecticut; but,
when they were apprised that they were making preparations for a settlement
there, they repented the invitation, and spared no exertion to prevent
them.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June the Dutch had sent Jacob Van Curter to purchase
lands upon the Connecticut. He made a purchase of about twenty acres
at Hartford, of Nepuquash, a Pequot captain. Of this the Dutch took
possession in October, and on the 25th of the month Curter protested
against William Holmes, the builder of the Plymouth house. Some time
afterward the Dutch Governor, Walter Van Twiller, of Fort Amsterdam,
dispatched a reënforcement to Connecticut, designing to drive Holmes
and his company from the river. A band of seventy men, under arms,
with banners displayed, assaulted the Plymouth house, but they found it
so well fortified, and the men who kept it so vigilant and determined,
that it could not be taken without bloodshed; they therefore came to a
parley, and finally returned in peace.</p>

<p>About the beginning of June, 1636, Mr. Hooker, Mr. Stone, and about
one hundred men, women, and children, took their departure from Cambridge,
and traveled more than one hundred miles through a hideous and
trackless wilderness to Hartford. They had no guide but their compass;
made their way over mountains, through swamps, thickets, and rivers,
which were not passable but with difficulty. They had no cover but the
heavens, nor any lodgings but what simple Nature afforded them. They
drove with them one hundred and sixty head of cattle, and by the way
subsisted upon the milk of their cows. Mrs. Hooker was borne through
the wilderness upon a litter. The people generally carried their packs,
arms, and utensils. They were nearly a fortnight on their journey.</p>

 While the planters of Connecticut were thus exerting themselves in
prosecuting and regulating the affairs of that colony, another was projected
and settled at Quinnipiack, and afterward called New Haven. On
the 26th of July, 1637, Mr. John Davenport, Mr. Samuel Eaton, Theophilus
Eaton, and Edward Hopkins, Esquires, Mr. Thomas Gregson, and
many others of good character and fortune, arrived in Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport had been a famous minister in the city of London, and
was a distinguished character for piety, learning, and good conduct.
Many of his congregation, on account of the esteem which they had for
his person and ministry, followed him to New England.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton and Mr. Hopkins had been merchants in London, possessed
great estates, and were men of eminence for their abilities and integrity.</p>

<p>The fame of Davenport, and the reputation and good estates of the
principal gentlemen of his company, made the people of Massachusetts
exceedingly desirous of their settlement in that Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Great pains were taken not only by particular persons and towns, but
by the General Court, to fix them in the colony.</p>

<p>Charlestown made them large offers, and Newbury proposed to give
up the whole town to them. The General Court offered them any place
which they should select. But they were determined to plant a distant
colony. By the pursuit of the Pequots to the westward, the English became
acquainted with that fine tract along the shore from Saybrook to
Fairfield, and with its several harbors. It was represented as fruitful,
and happily situated for navigation and commerce.</p>

<p>The company, therefore, projected a settlement in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1637 Mr. Eaton and others who were of the company
made a journey to Connecticut to explore the lands and harbors on the
sea-coast. They pitched upon Quinnipiack for the place of their settlement.
They erected a poor hut, in which a few men subsisted through
the winter.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, 1638, Mr. Davenport, Mr. Prudden, Mr. Samuel
Eaton, and Theophilus Eaton, Esquire, with the people of their company,
sailed from Boston to Quinnipiack. In about a fortnight they arrived at
their desired port.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April they kept their first Sabbath in the place.</p>

<p>The people assembled under a large, spreading oak, and Mr. Davenport
preached to them from Matthew <abbr title="verse">v.</abbr> 1. He discoursed on the temptations
of man, and made such observations as were pertinent to the then
present state of his hearers. He left this remark, that he enjoyed a good
day.</p>

 While the colonists were thus prosecuting the business of settlement
in New England, the Right Honorable James, Marquis of Hamilton, obtained
a grant from the Council of Plymouth April 20, 1635, of all that
tract of country which lies between Connecticut River and Narraganset
River and harbor, from the mouth of each of said rivers northward sixty
miles into the country.</p>

<p>However, by reason of its interference with the grant to Lords Say
and Brook, and others, or for some other reason, the deed was never
executed.</p>

<p>The marquis made no settlement on the land, and the claim became
obsolete.</p>

<p> <a name="footnote_11" id="footnote_11"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_11"><span class="muchsmaller">[11]</span></a>
 Such numbers were constantly emigrating to New England, in consequence
of the persecution of the Puritans, that the people of Dorchester,
Watertown, and Newtown, began to be much straitened by the
accession of new planters.</p>

<p>By those who had been in Connecticut they had received intelligence
of the excellent meadows on the river; they therefore determined to
remove, and once more brave the dangers and hardships of making settlements
in a dreary wilderness.</p>

<p>Upon application to the General Court for the enlargement of their
boundaries, or for liberty to remove, they at first obtained consent for
the latter. However, when it was afterward discovered that their determination
was to plant a new colony in Connecticut, there arose a strong
opposition; so that, when the Court convened, in September, there was
a warm debate on the subject, and a great division between the Houses.
Indeed, the whole colony was affected with the dispute.</p>

<p>Mr. Hooker, who was more engaged in the enterprise than the
other ministers, took up the affair and pleaded for the people. He
urged that they were so straitened for accommodations for their cattle,
that they could not support the ministry, neither receive nor assist any
more of their friends who might come over to them. He insisted that
the planting of towns so near together was a fundamental error in their
policy. He pleaded the fertility and happy accommodations of Connecticut;
that settlements upon the river were necessary to prevent the
Dutch, and others, from possessing themselves of so fruitful and important
a part of the country; and that the minds of the people were
strongly inclined to plant themselves there, in preference to every other
place which had come to their knowledge.</p>

<p>On the other side, it was insisted that, in point of conscience, they
ought not to depart, as they were united to Massachusetts as one body,
and bound by oath to seek the good of the Commonwealth; and that,
on principles of policy, it could not by any means be granted. It was
pleaded that the settlement in Massachusetts was new and weak; they
were in danger from an assault from their enemies; that the departure
of Mr. Hooker, and the people of those towns, would not only draw off
many from Massachusetts, but prevent others from settling in the colony.
Besides, it was said that the removing of a candlestick was a great judgment;
that, by suffering it, they should expose their brethren to great
danger, both from the Dutch and the Indians. Indeed, it was affirmed
that they might be accommodated by the enlargements offered them by
other towns.</p>

<p>After a long and warm debate, the Governor, two assistants, and a
majority of the representatives, were for granting liberty for Mr. Hooker
and the people to transport themselves to Connecticut. The Deputy-Governor,
however, and six of the assistants, were in the negative, and
so no vote was obtained.</p>

<p>The next May the Newtown people determined to settle at Connecticut,
renewed their application to the General Court, and obtained liberty
to remove to any place which they should select, with the proviso that
they should continue under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 The Indian mode of counting is from one to twenty. Every year
they cut a notch in a stick, and when the stick is full, or has twenty
notches on it, they lay it up and take another. When they have thus cut
twenty sticks, they reckon no more; the number of twenty times twenty
with them becomes infinite, or incomprehensible.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 It was the opinion of the principal divines who settled in New England
and Connecticut that in every church completely organized there
was a pastor, teacher, ruling elder, and deacons.</p>

<p>Three distinct offices, they said, were clearly taught in those passages.—Romans
xii. 7: “Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or
he that teacheth on teaching.” 1 Timothy <abbr title="verse">v.</abbr> 17: “Let the elders that
rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor
in the word and doctrine.” 1 Corinthians xii. 28: “And God has set
some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,
after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities
of tongues.” And Ephesians iv. 11: “And he gave some, apostles; and
some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.”
From these they argued the duty of all churches which were able to be
thus furnished. In this manner were the churches of Hartford, Windsor,
New Haven, and other towns, organized.</p>

<p>The churches which were not able to support a pastor and teacher
had the ruling elders and deacons.</p>

<p>The ruling elders were ordained with no less solemnity than their pastors
and teachers. When no teacher could be obtained, the pastor performed
the duty of both pastor and teacher.</p>

<p>It was the general opinion that the pastor’s work consisted principally
in exhortation, in working upon the will and affections of the people. To
this the whole force of his study was to be directed, that by his judicious,
powerful, and affectionate addresses he might win his hearers to the love
and practice of the truth. But the teacher was <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Doctor in Ecclesia</span>, whose
business was to teach, and explain, and defend the doctrines of Christianity.
He was to inform the judgment, and advance the work of illumination.</p>

<p>The business of the ruling elder was to assist the pastor in the government
of the church. He was particularly set apart to watch over all
its members; to prepare and bring forward all cases of discipline; to
visit and pray with the sick; and, in absence of the pastor and teacher,
to pray with the congregation and expound the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The pastors and churches of New England maintained with the reformed
churches in general that bishops and presbyters were only different
names for the same office; and that all pastors regularly elected to
the gospel ministry were Scripture bishops. They also insisted, agreeably
to the primitive practice, that the work of every pastor was confined
principally to one particular church and congregation, who could all assemble
in one place, whom he could inspect, and who could all unite together
in acts of worship and discipline. Indeed, the first ministers of
Connecticut and New England at first maintained that all the pastor’s
office power was confined to his own church and congregation, and that
the administering of baptism and the Lord’s Supper in other churches
was irregular.</p>

<p>With respect to ordination, they held that it did not constitute the
essentials of ministerial office; but the qualifications for office were the
election of the church, guided by the rule of Christ, and the acceptance
of the pastor-elect. Says Mr. Hooker, “Ordination is an approbation of
the officer, and solemn setting and confirmation of him in his office by
prayer and laying on of hands.”</p>

<p>It was viewed by the ministers of New England as no more than putting
the pastor-elect in office, or a solemn recommending of him and his
labors to the blessing of God. It was the general opinion that elders
ought to lay on hands in ordination if there were a presbytery in the
church, but, if there were not, the church might appoint some other
elders, or a number of the brethren, to perform that service.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

<p> <a name="footnote_15" id="footnote_15"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_15"><span class="muchsmaller">[15]</span></a>
 On the 4th of June, 1689, all the free planters at Quinnipiack convened
in a large barn of Mr. Newman’s, and, in a very formal and solemn
manner, proceeded to lay the foundations of their civil and religious
polity.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport introduced the business by a sermon from the words
of the royal preacher, “Wisdom has builded her house, she has hewn out
seven pillars.”</p>

<p>His design was to show that the church, the house of God, should be
formed of seven pillars, or principal brethren, to whom all the other members
of the church should be added. After a solemn invocation of the
Divine Majesty, he proceeded to represent to the planters that they were
met to consult respecting the settlement of civil government, according to
the will of God, and for the nomination of persons who, by universal consent,
were in all respects the best qualified for the foundation-work of a
church. He enlarged on the great importance of the transactions before
them, and desired that no man would give his voice in any matter until
he fully understood it, and that all would act without respect to any man,
but give their vote in the fear of God.</p>

<p>He then proposed a number of questions, in consequence of which the
following resolutions were passed:</p>

<p class="blockquote">1. That the Scriptures hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and
government of all men in all duties which they are to perform to God and
man, as well in families and commonwealth as in matters of church.</p>

<p class="blockquote">2. That as in matters which concerned the gathering and ordering of
a church, so likewise in all public offices which concern civil order, as the
choice of magistrates and officers, making and repealing laws, dividing
allotments of inheritance, and all things of like nature, they would all be
governed by those rules which the Scripture held forth to them.</p>

<p class="blockquote">3. That all those who had desired to be received as free planters had
settled in the plantation with a purpose, resolution, and desire, that they
might be admitted into church-fellowship, according to Christ.</p>

<p class="blockquote">4. That all free planters held themselves bound to establish such civil
order as might best conduce to the securing of the purity and peace of the
ordinance to themselves and their posterity, according to God.</p>

<p>When these resolutions had been passed, and the people had bound
themselves to settle civil government according to the divine word, Mr.
Davenport proceeded to represent to them what men they must choose
according to the divine word, that they might most effectually secure to
themselves and their posterity a just, free, and peaceable government.</p>

<p>Time was then given to discuss and deliberate upon what had been
proposed. After full discussion and deliberation, it was determined:</p>

<p class="blockquote">5. That the church-members only should be free burgesses, and that
they should choose magistrates, among themselves, to have power of
transacting all the public civil affairs of the plantation, of making and
repealing laws, dividing inheritances, deciding of differences that may
arise, and doing all things and business of a like nature.</p>

<p>That civil officers might be chosen and government proceed according
to these resolutions, it was necessary that a church should be formed.
Without this there could be neither freedmen nor magistrates. Mr. Davenport
thereupon proceeded to make proposals relative to forming it, in
such a manner that no blemish might be left on the “beginnings of church
work.” It was then resolved to this effect<span class="lock">—</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">6. That twelve men should be chosen, that their fitness for the foundation-work
might be tried, and that it should be in the power of those
twelve men to choose seven to begin the church.</p>

<p>It was agreed that if seven men could not be found among the twelve
qualified for the foundation-work, that such other persons should be taken
into the number, upon trial, as should be judged more suitable. The form
of a solemn charge, or oath, was drawn up and agreed upon at this meeting,
to be given to all the freemen.</p>

<p>Further, it was ordered that all persons who should be received as free
planters of that corporation, should submit to the fundamental agreement
above related, and, in testimony of their submission, should subscribe
their names among the freemen. Sixty-three subscribed on the 4th of
June, and soon after fifty other names were added.</p>

<p>After a proper term of trial, Theophilus Eaton, Mr. John Davenport,
Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert, Thomas Fugill, John Punderson, and
Jeremiah Dixon, were chosen for the seven pillars of the church.</p>

<p>October 25, 1639, the Court, as it is termed, consisting of these seven
persons only, convened, and after a solemn address to the Supreme Majesty,
they proceeded to form a body of freemen, and to elect civil officers.
The manner was, indeed, singular and curious.</p>

<p>In the first place, all former trust for managing the public affairs of
the plantation was declared to cease, and be utterly abrogated. Then all
those who had been admitted to the church after the gathering of it in
the choice of the seven pillars, and all the members of other approved
churches who desired it, and offered themselves, were admitted members
of the Court.</p>

<p>A solemn charge was then publicly given them, to the same effect as
the freemen’s charge, or oath, which they had previously adopted. The
purport of this was nearly the same with the oath of fidelity at the present
time.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport expounded several scriptural texts to them, describing
the character of civil magistrates given in the sacred oracles. Theophilus
Eaton, Esq., was chosen Governor; Mr. Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert,
Nathaniel Turner, and Thomas Fugill, were chosen magistrates; Mr.
Fugill was also chosen secretary, and Robert Seeley, marshal.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport gave Governor Eaton a charge, in open Court, from
Deuteronomy <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 16, 17.</p>

<p>It was decreed by the freemen that there should be a General Court
annually in the plantation, on the first week in October. This was ordained
a court of election in which all the officers of the colony were to
be chosen. This Court determined that the word of God should be the
only rule for ordering affairs of government in that Commonwealth.</p>

<p>This was the original fundamental Constitution of the government of
New Haven. All government was originally in the church, and the members
of the church elected the Governor, magistrates, and other officers.
The magistrates at first were no more than assistants of the Governor;
they might not act in any sentence or determination of the Court.</p>

<p>No Deputy-Governor was chosen, nor were any laws enacted, except
the general resolutions which have been noticed; but as the plantation
enlarged, and new towns were settled, new orders were given; the General
Court received a new form, laws were enacted, and the civil polity of
this jurisdiction gradually advanced, in its essential parts, to a near
resemblance of the government of Connecticut.</p>

<p>Upon these resolutions were based the “Blue Laws” which will appear
in the work.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 William, Thomas, and Hugh Peters were brothers, and born in
Fowery, in Cornwall, in Old England. Their father was a merchant of
great property, and their mother was Elizabeth Treffry, daughter of John
Treffry, Esq., of a very ancient and opulent family in Fowery. William
was educated at Leyden, Thomas at Oxford, and Hugh at Cambridge Universities.
About the year 1610 and 1620, Thomas and Hugh were clergymen
in London, and William was a private gentleman. About 1628
Thomas and Hugh, rendered obnoxious by their popularity and Puritanism,
were silenced by the Bishop of London. They then went to Holland,
and remained there till 1633, when they returned to London. The
three brothers sold their landed property, and went to New-England in
1634. Hugh settled at Salem, and became too popular for Mather and
Cotton. He was soon appointed one of the Trustees of the College at
New-Cambridge. He built a grand house, and purchased a large tract of
land.—The yard before his house he paved with flint-stones from England;
and, having dug a well, he paved that round with flint-stones also,
for the accommodation of every inhabitant in want of water. It bears
the name of Peters’s Spring to this day.—He married a second wife, by
whom he had one daughter named Elizabeth. The renown of this zealot
increasing, he received an invitation to remove from Salem to Boston,
and, complying with it, he there laid the foundation-stone of the great
Meeting-House, of which the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Samuel Cooper, one of the most
learned of the Literati in America, is the present minister. Mather and
Cotton ill brooked being out-rivalled by Hugh; yet, finding him an orthodox
fanatic, and more perfect than themselves, they seemingly bowed
to his superiority, at the same time that they laid a snare for his destruction.
In 1641 those envious pastors conspired with the Court at Boston
to convert their Bishop Hugh into a Politician, and appoint him agent to
Great Britain.—The Plot succeeded; and Hugh assumed his agency
under colour of petitioning for some abatement of customs and excise;
but his real commission was to foment the civil discontents, jars, and
wars, then prevailing between the King and Parliament.—Hugh did not
see into the policy of Mather and Cotton; and he had a strong inclination
to chastise the Bishops and Court, who had turned him out of the
Church for his fanatical conduct. On his arrival in London, the Parliament
took him into their service.—The Earls of Warwick and Essex
were also his patrons.—In 1644, the Parliament gave him Archbishop
Laud’s library; and soon after made him Head of the Archbishop’s
Court, and gave him his estate and palace at Lambeth:—all of which
Hugh kept till the Restoration, when he paid for his zeal, his puritanism,
and rebellion, on a gibbet at Charing-Cross.—His daughter married a
merchant in Newport, Rhode-Island, and lived and died with an excellent
character.—Her Father having met with so tragical an end, I omit to
mention her Husband’s name, whose Posterity live in good reputation.—Governor
Hutchinson reports, that the widow of Hugh Peters was supported,
till 1671, by a collection at Salem, of 30<span class="abbrev">l.</span> per <abbr title="annum" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ann.</abbr> Were this
report true, it would be much to the reputation of Salem for having <em>once</em>
relieved the unfortunate. Mr. Hutchinson might have pointed out the
cause of the unhappy widow’s necessity; but he has left that part to me,
and here it follows:—After Hugh’s Death, the selectmen of Salem were
afraid that the King [Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>] would seize on his estate in Salem, as
had been the case in regard to what the Parliament had given him in England.
They therefore trumped up a debt, and seized and sold the said
estate to the families of Lyndes and Curwin, who possess it to the present
time;—and the selectmen of Salem allowed the widow 30<span class="abbrev">l.</span> per <abbr title="annum" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ann.</abbr>
for the wrong they had done her and her daughter. It is not likely that
the widow was supported by any charitable collection; for William Peters
was a man of great property, and had a deed of the whole peninsula
whereon Boston stands, which he purchased of Mr. Blaxton, who bought it
of the Plymouth Company; though Mr. Hutchinson says Blaxton’s title
arose merely from his sleeping on it the first of any Englishman.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>—This
was well said by Mr. Hutchinson, who wanted to justify the people of
Salem in seizing the land and expelling Mr. Blaxton from his settlement
in 1630, because he said he liked Lords-Brethren less than Lords-Bishops.—Moreover,
Thomas Peters, at the same time, was living at Saybrook,
and was not poor.—Those two Gentlemen were able and willing to support
the widow of an unfortunate brother whom they loved very tenderly.—They
took great care of his daughter, and left her handsome legacies.—From
these considerations, I am induced to believe, that the widow
of Hugh Peters never subsisted on any contributions, except what she
received from her brothers William and Thomas Peters.—Mr. Hutchinson
makes a curious remark, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, If Hugh Peters had returned to his
parish, he would not have suffered as he did.—He might have said, with
greater propriety, that, if Hugh Peters had not been a fanatic and a
rebel more zealous than wise, he never would have left his Parish for the
agency of the people of New-England, who never paid him the stipulated
allowance for his support in England, tho’ he gave them thanksgiving-days,
instead of fasting, for the space of twenty years, and procured, in
1649, from Oliver Cromwell, a <a name="Note16" id="Note16"></a>charter for the Company for propagating
the Gospel in New-England, which, by contributions raised in England,
have supported all the missionaries among the Indians to the present
time;—yet Mr. Hutchinson and Neal write largely about the vast expense
the Massachusets-Bay have been at in spreading the Gospel among the
poor savages!</p>

<p>I cannot forbear here to notice an abuse of this charter. Notwithstanding
it confines the views of the Company to New-England, yet they,
and their Committee of Correspondence in Boston, have of late years
vouchsafed to send most of their Missionaries out of New-England,
among the Six Nations, and the unsanctified episcopalians in the Southern
Colonies, where was a competent number of church clergymen.
Whenever this work of supererogation has met with its deserved animadversion,
their answer has been, that, though Cromwell limited them
to New-England, yet Christ had extended their bounds from sea to sea!
With what little reason do they complain of King William’s charter to
the <a name="Note16b" id="Note16b"></a>Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts? This
Society have sent Missionaries to New-England, where they have an undoubted
right to send them, to supply episcopal Churches already established there;
whereas the other Society send Missionaries beyond the
limits of their charter, to alienate the minds of the episcopal Indians of
the Six Nations, against the episcopal Missionaries and the Government
of the Mother-Country.—And they have been too successful; especially
since the <a name="Note16c" id="Note16c"></a><abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Eleazer Wheelock, Dr. Whitaker, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr.
Sampson Occom, by the Charity of England, have joined in the same
work.—To the General Assembly, and the Consociation of Connecticut,
Dr. Wheelock and his associates are much beholden for their success in
converting the poor benighted savages in the howling wilderness. Their
merits are great, and their reward is pending.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 “The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Blaxton had lived on Shawmut, or the peninsula on
which Boston is built, above nine years before June, 1630, when he was
driven away from his possessions by the pious people of Salem, because
he was not pleased with the religious system of those new-comers.—They
were so generous as to vote a small lot to Mr. Blaxton, near Boston-Neck,
as a compensation for the whole peninsula, and for his banishment
on pain of death not to return.—Blaxton afterwards sold his right to
William Peters, Esq. but who was kept out of possession of it by the
supreme power of the People.—”</p>

 As tobacco about this time was coming into use in the colony, a
very curious law was made for its regulation or suppression. It was ordered
that no person under twenty years of age, nor any other who had
not already accustomed himself to the use of it, should take any tobacco
until he had obtained a certificate, from under the hand of an approved
physician, that it was useful for him, and until he had also obtained a
license from the Court. All others who had addicted themselves to the use
of it were prohibited from taking it in any company, or at their labors,
or in traveling, unless ten miles at least from any company; and, though
not in company, not more than once a day, upon pain of a fine of a sixpence
for every offense. One substantial witness was to be sufficient
proof of the crime.</p>

<p>The constables of the several towns were to make presentment to the
particular Courts, and it was ordered that the fine should be paid without
gainsaying.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 An affair had happened at New Haven, a few months before this,
which now began to alarm the country, and soon gave great anxiety and
trouble to the colony.</p>

<p>Very soon after the restoration, a large number of judges of King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, commonly termed regicides, were apprehended and brought
upon their trials in the Old Bailey. Thirty-nine were condemned, and
ten executed as traitors. Some others, apprehensive of danger, fled out
of the kingdom before King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was proclaimed. Colonels Whalley
and Goffe made their escape to New England.</p>

<p>They were brought over by one Captain Gooking, and arrived in Boston
in July, 1660. Governor Endicott, and gentlemen of character in
Boston and its vicinity, treated them with peculiar respect and kindness.
They were gentlemen of singular abilities, and had moved in an exalted
sphere. Whalley had been a lieutenant-general, and Goffe a major-general,
in Cromwell’s army. Their manners and appearance commanded
universal respect. They soon went from Boston to Cambridge, where
they resided until February. They resorted openly to places of public
worship on the Lord’s-day, and at other times of public devotion. They
were universally esteemed by all men of character, both civil and religious.
But no sooner was it known that the judges had been condemned
as traitors, and that these gentlemen were excepted from the act of pardon,
than the principal gentlemen in the Massachusetts began to be
alarmed.</p>

<p>Governor Endicott called a court of magistrates to consult measures
for apprehending them. However, their friends were so numerous that
a vote could not at that time be obtained to arrest them. Some of the
court declared that they would stand by them; others advised them to
move out of the colony.</p>

<p>Finding themselves unsafe at Cambridge, they came, by the assistance
of their friends, to Connecticut. They made their route by Hartford, and
went directly to New Haven. They arrived about the 27th of March,
and made Mr. Davenport’s house the place of their residence.</p>

<p>They were treated with the same marks of esteem and generous friendship
at New Haven which they had received in Massachusetts. The more
the people became acquainted with them the more they esteemed them,
not only as men of great minds, but of unfeigned piety and religion. For
some time they appeared to apprehend themselves as out of danger, and
happily situated among a number of pious and agreeable friends. But it
was not long before the news of the king’s proclamation against the regicides
arrived, requiring that, wherever they might be found, they should
be immediately apprehended. The Governor of Massachusetts, in consequence
of the royal proclamation, issued his warrant to arrest them. As
they were informed by their friends of all measures adopted respecting
them, they removed to Milford. There they appeared openly in daytime,
but at night often returned privately to New Haven, and were generally
secreted at Mr. Davenport’s, until about the last of April.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Governor of Massachusetts received a royal
mandate requiring him to apprehend them; and a more full circumstantial
account of the condemnation and the execution of the ten regicides,
and of the disposition of the Court toward them, and the republicans and
Puritans in general, arrived in New England.</p>

<p>This gave a more general and thorough alarm to the whole
country.</p>

<p>A feigned search had been made in the Massachusetts, in consequence
of the former warrant, for the Colonels Whalley and Goffe; but now the
Governor and magistrates began to view the affair in a more serious point
of light, and appear to have been in earnest to secure them. They perceived
that their own personal safety and the liberties and peace of the
country were concerned in the manner of their conduct toward these unhappy
men. They therefore immediately gave a commission to Thomas
Kellond and Thomas Kirk, two zealous young royalists, to go through the
colonies as far as Manhadoes, and make a careful and universal search
for them. They pursued the judges to Hartford, and, repairing to Governor
Winthrop’s, were nobly entertained.</p>

<p>He assured them that the colonels had made no stay in Connecticut,
but went directly to New Haven. He gave them a warrant, and instructions
similar to those which they had received from the Governor of Massachusetts,
and transacted everything relative to the affair with dispatch.
The next day they arrived at Guilford, and opened their business to
Deputy-Governor Leet. They acquainted him that, according to the intelligence
which they had received, the regicides were at New Haven.
They desired immediately to be furnished with powers, horses, and assistance,
to arrest them.</p>

<p>But here they were very unwelcome messengers. Governor Leet and
the principal gentlemen in Guilford and New Haven had no ill opinion of
the judges. If they had done wrong in the part they had acted, they
viewed it as an error in judgment, and as the fault of great and good
men, under peculiar and extraordinary circumstances. They were touched
with compassion and sympathy, and had real scruples of conscience with
respect to delivering up such men to death. They viewed them as the
“excellent of the earth,” and were afraid to betray them, lest they should
be instrumental in shedding innocent blood. They saw no advantage in
putting them to death.</p>

<p>They were not zealous, therefore, to assist in apprehending them.
Governor Leet said he had not seen them in nine weeks, and that he did
not believe they were at New Haven. He read some of the papers relative
to the affair with an audible voice.</p>

<p>The pursuivants observed to him that their business required more
secrecy than was consistent with such a reading of their instructions.
He delayed furnishing them with horses until the next morning, and utterly
declined giving them any powers until he had consulted his Council
at New Haven.</p>

<p>They complained that an Indian went off from Guilford to New Haven
in the night, and that the Governor was so dilatory the next morning that
a messenger went on to New Haven before they could obtain horses for
their assistance. The judges were apprized of every transaction respecting
them, and they and their friends took their measures accordingly.
They changed their quarters from one place to another in the town as
circumstances required, and had faithful friends to give them information,
and to conceal them from their enemies.</p>

<p>On the 13th of March the pursuers came to New Haven, and Governor
Leet arrived in town soon after them to consult his Council. They acquainted
him that, from the information they had received, they were
persuaded that the judges were yet in town, and pressed him and the
magistrates to give them a warrant and assistance to arrest them without
any further delay.</p>

<p>But, after the Governor and his Council had been together five or six
hours, they dispersed without doing anything relative to the affair. The
Governor declared that he could not act without calling a general assembly
of the freedmen.</p>

<p>Kellond and Kirk observed to him that the other governors had not
stood upon such niceties; that the honor and justice of his Majesty were
concerned, and that he would highly resent the concealment and abetting
of such traitors and regicides.</p>

<p>They demanded whether he and his Council would own and honor his
Majesty? The Governor replied: “We do honor his Majesty, but have
tender consciences, and wish first to know whether he will own us.”—(Report
of Kellond and Kirk to Governor Endicott, to which they gave
oath in the presence of the Governor and Council.)</p>

<p>The tradition is, that the pursuers searched Mr. Davenport’s house,
and used him very ill. They also searched other houses where they suspected
that the regicides were concealed. The report is that they went
into the house of one Mrs. Eyers, where they actually were concealed, but
she conducted the affair with such composure and address that they imagined
that the judges had just made their escape from the house, and
they went off without making any search. It is said that once, when the
pursuers passed a bridge, the judges were concealed under it. Several
times they narrowly escaped, but never could be taken.</p>

<p>The zealous royalists, not finding the judges in New Haven, prosecuted
their journey to the Dutch settlement, and made interest with Stuyvesant,
the Dutch Governor, against them. He promised them that, if the
judges should be found within his jurisdiction, he would give them immediate
intelligence, and that he would prohibit all ships and vessels from
transporting them.</p>

<p>Having thus zealously prosecuted the business of their commission,
they returned to Boston, and reported the reception which they had met
with at Guilford and New Haven.</p>

<p>Upon this report, a letter was written by Secretary Rawson, in the
name of the General Court of Massachusetts, to Governor Leet and his
Council, on the subject. It represented that many complaints had been
exhibited in England against the colonies, and that they were in great
danger. It was observed that one great source of complaint was their
giving such entertainment to the regicides, and their inattention to his
Majesty’s warrant for their arrest. This was represented as an affair
which hazarded the liberties of all the colonies, and especially those of
New Haven. It was intimated that the safety of particular persons, no less
than that of the colony, was in danger. It insisted that the only way to
expiate their offense, and save themselves harmless, was without delay to
apprehend the delinquents. Indeed, the Court urged that not only their
own safety and welfare, but the essential interests of their neighbors, demanded
their indefatigable exertions to exculpate themselves.</p>

<p>Colonels Whalley and Goffe, after the search which had been made
for them at New Haven, left Mr. Davenport’s, and took up their quarters
at Mr. William Jones’s, son-in-law to Governor Eaton, and afterward
Deputy-Governor of New Haven and Connecticut. There they secreted
themselves until the 11th of May.</p>

<p>Thence they removed to a mill in the environs of the town. For a
short time they made their quarters in the woods, and then fixed them in
a cave in the side of a hill, which they named Providence Hill. They
had some other places of resort, to which they retired as occasion made
 necessary, but this was generally the place of their residence until the
19th of August. When the weather was bad, they lodged at night in a
neighboring house. It is not improbable that sometimes, when it could
be done with safety, they made visits to their friends at New Haven.</p>

<p>In fact, to prevent any damage to Mr. Davenport or the colony, they
once or more came into the town openly and offered to deliver up themselves
to save their friends. It seems it was fully expected at that time
that they would have done it voluntarily, but their friends neither desired
nor advised them by any means to adopt so dangerous a measure. They
hoped to save themselves and the colony harmless without such a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The magistrates were greatly blamed for not apprehending them at
this time in particular. Secretary Rawson, in a letter of his to Governor
Leet, writes: “How ill this will be taken, is not difficult to imagine—to
be sure, not well. Nay, will not all men condemn you as wanting to yourselves?”</p>

<p>The General Court of Massachusetts further acquainted Governor Leet
that the colonies were criminated by making no application to the king
since his restoration, and for not proclaiming him as their king. The
Court, in their letter, observed that it was highly necessary that they
should send an agent to answer for them at the Court of England.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr>

<a href="#fnanchor_23"><span class="muchsmaller">[23]</span></a>
 About this time, it seems, Governor Winthrop took passage for
England. Upon his arrival he made application to Lord Say and Seal,
and other friends of the colony, for their countenance and assistance.
Lord Say and Seal appear to have been the only nobleman living who
was one of the original patentees of Connecticut. He held the patent
in trust, originally, for the puritanic exiles. He received the address
from the colony most favorably, and gave Governor Winthrop all the
assistance in his power. The Governor was a man of address, and he
arrived in England at a happy time for Connecticut.</p>

<p>Lord Say and Seal, the great friend of the colony, had been particularly
instrumental in the restoration. This had so brought him into the
king’s favor, that he had been made Privy Seal.</p>

<p>The Earl of Manchester, another friend of the Puritans and of the
rights of the colonies, was chamberlain of his Majesty’s household; he
was an intimate friend of Lord Say and Seal, and had been united with
him in defending the colonies, and pleading for their establishment and
liberties. Lord Say and Seal engaged him to give Mr. Winthrop his
utmost assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop had an extraordinary ring, which had been given to
his grandfather by King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, which he presented to the king.
This, it is said, exceedingly pleased his Majesty, as it had been once the
property of a father most dear to him. Under these circumstances the
petition for Connecticut was presented and received with uncommon
grace and favor.</p>

<p>Upon the 20th of April, 1662, his Majesty granted the colony his
letters patent, conveying the most ample privileges, under the great seal
of England. It confirmed unto it the whole tract of country granted by
King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> to the Earl of Warwick, and which was the next year
by him consigned to Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook, and others.</p>

<p>The patent granted the lands in fee and common socage. The facts
stated and pleaded in the petition were recognized in the Charter, nearly
in the same form of words, as reasons for the royal grant, and of the
ample privileges it conveyed.</p>

<p>It ordained that John Winthrop, John Mason, Samuel Wyllys, Henry
Clark, Matthew Allen, John Tapping, Nathan Gould, Richard Treat,
Richard Lord, Henry Wolcott, John Talcott, Daniel Clark, John Ogden,
Thomas Welles, Obadiah Brune, John Clark, Anthony Hawkins, John
Deming, and Matthew Camfield, and all such others as there were, or
should afterward be, admitted and made free of the corporation, should
forever after be one body corporate and politic, in fact and name, by
the name of the Governor and Company of the English Colony of Connecticut,
in New England, in America; and that, by the same name,
they and their successors should have perpetual succession. They were
capacitated, as persons in law, to plead and be impleaded, to defend and
be defended, in all suits whatsoever; to purchase, possess, lease, grant,
demise, and sell lands, tenements, and goods, in as ample a manner as
any of his Majesty’s subjects or corporations in England. The Charter
ordained that there should be, annually, two General Assemblies; one
holden on the second Thursday in May, and the other on the second
Thursday in October. This was to consist of the Governor, Deputy-Governor,
and twelve assistants, with two deputies from every town or city.
John Winthrop was appointed Governor, and John Mason Deputy-Governor,
and the gentlemen named above, magistrates, until a new election
should be made.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

<p> <a name="footnote_24" id="footnote_24"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_24"><span class="muchsmaller">[24]</span></a>
 Before the session of the General Assembly of Connecticut, in
October, the Charter was brought over; and, as the Governors and
magistrates appointed by his Majesty were not authorized to serve after
this time, a general election was appointed on the 9th of October. John
Winthrop, Esq., was chosen Governor, and John Mason, Esq., Deputy-Governor;
the magistrates were those mentioned in the patent, and were
appointed by his Majesty, with Mr. Baker and Mr. Sherman; and John
Talcott, Esq., was Treasurer, and Daniel Clark, Esq., Secretary.</p>

<p>Upon the day of the election the Charter was publicly read to the
freemen, and declared to belong to them and their successors. They
then proceeded to make choice of Mr. Wyllys, Mr. Talcott, and Mr.
Allen, to receive the Charter into their custody, and keep it in behalf of
the colony. It was ordered that an oath should be administered by the
court to the freemen, binding them to a faithful discharge of the trust
committed to them.</p>

<p>The General Assembly established all former officers, civil and military,
in their respective places of trust, and enacted that all the laws of
the colony should be continued in full force, except such as should be
found contrary to the tenor of the Charter. It was also enacted that the
same colony seal should be continued.</p>

<p>The major part of the inhabitants of Southhold, several of the people
of Guilford, and of the towns of Stamford and Greenwich, tendered their
persons and estates to Connecticut, and, petitioning to enjoy the protection
and privileges of the Commonwealth, were accepted by the Assembly,
and promised the same protection and freedom which was common
to the inhabitants of the colony in general. At the same time, it was
enjoined on them to conduct themselves peaceably, as became Christians,
toward their neighbors, who did not submit to the jurisdiction of Connecticut;
and that they should pay all taxes due the ministers, with all
the other public charges then due. A message was sent to the Dutch
Governor, certifying him of the Charter granted to Connecticut, and
desiring him by no means to trouble any of his Majesty’s subjects, within
its limits, with impositions or prosecutions from that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Assembly gave notice to the inhabitants of Winchester that they
were comprehended within the limits of Connecticut, and ordered that,
as his Majesty had thus disposed of them, they should conduct themselves
as peaceable subjects.</p>

<p>Huntington, Setauket, Oyster Bay, and all the towns on Long Island,
were obliged to submit to the authority and govern themselves agreeably
to the laws of Connecticut. A court was instituted at Southhold, consisting
of Captain James Youngs, and the justices of South and East Hampton.
The Assembly resolved that all the towns which should be received
under their jurisdiction should bear their equal proportion of the charge
of the colony in procuring the patent.</p>

<p>As the Charter included the colony of New Haven, Matthew Allen,
Samuel Wyllys, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Messrs. Stone and Hooker, were appointed
a committee to proceed to New Haven, and treat with their friends there
respecting an amicable union of the two colonies.</p>

<p>The committee proceeded to New Haven, and, after a conference
with the Governor, magistrates, and principal gentlemen in the colony,
left the following declaration to be communicated to the freemen:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We declare that, through the providence of the Most High, a large
and ample patent, and therein desirable privileges and immunities from
his Majesty, being come to our hands, a copy whereof we have left with
you to be considered, and yourselves, upon the sea-coast, being included
and interested therein, the king having united us in one body politic,
we, according to the commission wherewith we are intrusted by the
General Assembly of Connecticut, do declare, in their name, that it is
both their and our earnest desire, that there may be a happy and comfortable
union between us and yourselves, according to the tenor of the
Charter; that inconveniences and dangers may be prevented, peace and
truth strengthened and established through our suitable subjection of the
terms of the patent, and the blessing of God on us therein.”</p>

<p>The authority of New Haven made the following reply:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We have received and perused your writings, and heard the copy
read of his Majesty’s letters patent to the Connecticut colony; wherein,
though we do not find the colony of New Haven expressly included, yet,
to show our desire that matters may be issued in the conserving of peace
and amity, with righteousness between them and us, we shall communicate
your writings, and a copy of the patent, to the freemen, and afterward
with convenient speed return their answer. Only we desire that
the issuing of matters may be respited until we may receive fuller
information from Mr. Winthrop, or satisfaction otherwise; and that, in
the meantime, this colony may remain distinct, entire, and uninterrupted,
as heretofore; which we hope you will see cause lovingly to assent unto,
and signify the same to us with convenient speed.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of November the freemen of the colony of New Haven
convened in General Court. The Governor communicated the writings
to the court, and ordered a copy of the patent to be read. After a short
adjournment for consideration in an affair of so much importance, the
freemen met again, and proceeded to discuss the subject.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Davenport was entirely opposed to a union with Connecticut.
He proceeded, therefore, to offer a number of reasons why the
inhabitants of New Haven could not be included in the patent of that
colony, and for which they ought, by no means voluntary, to form a
union. He left his reasons in writing, for the consideration of the freemen.
He observed that he should leave others to act, according to the
light which they should receive.</p>

<p>It was insisted that New Haven had been owned as a distinct government,
not only by her sister colonies, by Parliament, and the Protector,
during their administration, but by his Majesty, King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; that
it was against the express articles of confederation, by which Connecticut
was no less bound than the other colonies; that New Haven had never
been notified of any design as to their incorporation with Connecticut,
and that they had never been heard on the subject. It was further
urged that, had it been designed to unite them with Connecticut, some
of their names, at least, would have been put into the patent, with the
other patentees; but none of them were there. Hence it was maintained
that it never could have been the design of his Majesty to comprehend
them within the limits of the Charter.</p>

<p>It was argued, that for them to consent to a union would be inconsistent
with their oath to maintain that Commonwealth, with all its
privileges, civil and religious. It was also urged that it would be incompatible
both with their honor and most essential interests.</p>

<p>After the affair had been fully debated, the freemen resolved that an
answer to Connecticut should be drawn up under the following heads:</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> “Bearing a proper testimony against the great sin of Connecticut
in acting so contrary to righteousness, amity, and peace.</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> “Desiring that all future proceedings relative to the affair might
be suspended until Mr. Winthrop should return, or they might otherwise
obtain further information and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> “To represent that they could do nothing in the affair until
they had consulted the other confederates.”</p>

<p>The magistrates and elders, with Mr. Law, of Stamford, were appointed
a committee, and drew up a long letter in reply to the General
Assembly of Connecticut, stating that they did not find any command in
the patent to dissolve covenants and alter orderly settlements of New
England, nor a prohibition against their continuance as a distinct government.
They represented that the conduct of Connecticut, in acting
at first without them, confirmed them in those sentiments; and that the
way was still open for them to petition his Majesty, and obtain immunities
similar to those of Connecticut. They declared that they must
enter their appeal from the construction which Connecticut put upon the
patent, and desired that they might not be interrupted in the enjoyment
of their distinct privileges.</p>

<p>The committee also represented that these transactions were entirely
inconsistent with the engagement of Governor Winthrop, contrary to his
advice to Connecticut, and tended to bring injurious reflections and reproach
upon him. They earnestly prayed for a copy of all which he had
written to the Deputy-Governor and the Company on the subject. On
the whole, they professed themselves exceedingly injured and grieved,
and entreated the General Assembly of Connecticut to adopt speedy
and effectual measures to repair the breaches which they had made,
and to restore them to their former state, as a confederate and sister
colony.</p>

<p>Connecticut made no reply to this letter, but, at a General Assembly
held March 11, 1663, the Deputy-Governor, Matthew and John Allen,
and John Talcott, were appointed a committee to treat with their friends
in New Haven on the subject of a union. But the hasty measures of
the General Assembly in admitting the disaffected members of the
several towns under the jurisdiction of New Haven, before they had
invited them to incorporate with them, had so soured their minds and
prejudiced them, that this committee had no better success than the
former.</p>

<p>While these affairs were transacted in the colonies, the petition and
address of New Haven to his Majesty arrived in England; upon which,
Governor Winthrop, who was yet there, by advice of friends of both
colonies, agreed that no injury should be done to New Haven, and that
the union and incorporation of the two colonies should be voluntary.
Therefore, on the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> day of March, 1663, he wrote to the Deputy-Governor
and Company of Connecticut, certifying them of his engagements
to the agent of New Haven, and that, before he took out the Charter,
he had given assurance to their friends that their interest and privileges
should not be injured by the patent. He represented that they were
bound by the assurance he had given, and therefore wished them to
abstain from all further injury and trouble to that colony. He imputed
what they had done to their ignorance of the engagements which he had
made. At the same time, he intimated his assurance that, on his return,
he should be able to effect an amicable union of the colonies.</p>

<p>Connecticut now laid claim to Westchester, and sent one of her
magistrates to lead the inhabitants to a choice of their officers, and to
administer the proper oaths to such as they should elect.</p>

<p>The colony also extended their claim to the Narragansett country,
and appointed officers for the government of the inhabitants of Wickford.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the remonstrance of the court at New Haven, their
appeal to King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and the engagements of Governor Winthrop,
Connecticut pursued the affair of a union in the same manner in which
it was begun. At a session of the General Assembly, August 19, 1663,
a committee was again appointed to treat with their friends at New
Haven, Milford, Guilford, and Branford, relative to their incorporation
with Connecticut. Provided they could not effect a union by treaty,
they were authorized to read the Charter publicly at New Haven, and to
make declaration to the people there that the Assembly could not but
resent their proceedings as a distinct jurisdiction, since they were
evidently included within the limits of the Charter granted to the corporation
of Connecticut. They were instructed to proclaim that the Assembly
did desire, and could not but expect, that the inhabitants of the
above towns would yield subjection to the government of Connecticut.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the commissioners in September in the same year,
New Haven was owned by the colonies as a distinct confederation.
Governor Leet and Mr. Fenn, who had been sent from that jurisdiction,
exhibited a complaint against Connecticut for the injuries they had done,
by encroaching upon their rights, receiving their members under their
government, and encouraging them to disown their authority, to disregard
their oath of allegiance, and to refuse all attendance on their
courts. They further complained that Connecticut had appointed constables
in several of their towns, to the great disquiet and injury of the
colony. They prayed that effectual measures might be taken to redress
their grievances, to prevent further injuries, and secure their rights as a
distinct confederation.</p>

<p>Governor Winthrop and Mr. John Talcott, commissioners from Connecticut,
replied that, in their opinion, New Haven had no just grounds
of complaint; that Connecticut had never designed them any injury, but
had made to them the most friendly propositions, inviting them to share
with them freely in all the important and distinguishing privileges which
they had obtained for themselves; that they had sent committees amicably
to treat with them; that they were still treating, and would attend
all just and friendly means of accommodation.</p>

<p>The commissioners of the other colonies, having fully heard the
parties, determined that “where any act of power had been exerted
against the authority of New Haven, the same ought to be recalled, and
their power reserved to them entire, until such time as, in an orderly way,
it shall be otherwise disposed.” With respect to the particular grievances
mentioned by the commissioners of New Haven, the consideration of them
was referred to the next meeting of the commissioners at Hartford.</p>

<p>In this situation of affairs an event took place which alarmed all the
New England colonies, and at once changed the opinion of the commissioners,
and of New Haven, with respect to their incorporation with Connecticut.</p>

<p>King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, on the 12th of March, 1664, gave a patent to
his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, of several extensive tracts
of land in North America, the boundaries of which are thus described:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“All that part of the main land of New-England, beginning at a certain
place called and known by the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, next adjoining to
New-England, in America, and from thence extending along the sea-coast
into a certain place called Pemaquie, or Pemaquid, and so up the river
thereof to the furthest head of the same, as it tendeth northward, and
from thence extending to the river Hembequin, and so upward, by the
shortest course, to the river Canada northward; and also all that island
or islands commonly called by the general name or names of Meitowax, or
Long-Island, situate and being toward the west of Cape Cod, and the
narrow Highgansets abutting on the main land, between the two rivers,
these called and known by the several names of Connecticut and Hudson’s
Rivers; and all the land on the west side of Connecticut River, to
the east side of the Delaware-Bay; and also all those several islands
called or known by the names of Martin’s Vineyard, or Nantucks, otherwise
Nantucket: together,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The concern of the Duke of York for his property, and the aversion
both he and his Majesty had for the Dutch, led them to dispatch an army
and fleet to New England for the reduction of the Dutch settlement on
the continent. Colonel Richard Nichols was chief commander of the
fleet and army. Sir Robert Carr, George Cartwirth, and Samuel Maverick,
Esq., were appointed commissioners with him, to determine all
matters of complaint and controversy, and settling the country in peace.</p>

<p>Colonel Nichols arrived in Boston, with the fleet and troops under his
command, on the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of July, 1664. He then sailed for the New Netherlands
on the 20th of August, and made a demand of the town and forts
upon the island of Manhadoes. Governor Winthrop, and several magistrates
and principal gentlemen of Connecticut, joined him at the west
end of Long Island, according to his request.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant, the Dutch Governor, was an old soldier, and, had he been
better prepared and the people united, doubtless could have made a brave
defense. But he had no intimations of the design until the 8th of July,
when he received intelligence that a fleet of three or four ships of war,
with three hundred and fifty soldiers on board, were about to sail from
England against the Dutch settlements. Upon this he immediately ordered
that the forts should be put in a state of defense, and sent out spies into
several parts of Connecticut for further information. It has been said
that the Dutch Governor was negotiating a neutrality with Connecticut
when he received the news of the fleet’s arrival in Boston. Stuyvesant
was extremely opposed to a surrender of the fort and town. Instead of
submitting to the summons at first sent him, he drew up a long statement
of the Dutch claims, and their indubitable right to the country.
He insisted that, had the king of England known the justice of their
claims, he never would have adopted such measures against them. He
concluded by assuring Colonel Nichols that he should not submit to his
demands, nor fear any evils but such as God in his providence should
inflict upon him.</p>

<p>Colonel Nichols, in his first summons, had in his Majesty’s name
given assurance that the Dutch, upon their submission, should be safe as
to life, liberty, and property. Governor Winthrop also wrote a letter to
the Governor and Council, advising them to surrender. But they were
careful to secrete the writings from the people, lest the easy terms proposed
should induce them to surrender. The burgomasters and people
desired to know of the Governor what was the import of the writings he
had received, and especially of the letter from Governor Winthrop. The
Dutch Governor and his Council giving them no intelligence, they solicited
it the more earnestly. The Governor, irritated at this, in a paroxysm
of anger tore the letters to pieces; upon which the people protested
against his conduct and all its consequences.</p>

<p>While the Governor and Council were thus contending with the burgomasters
and people, the English commissioners issued a proclamation
to all the inhabitants who would become subject to his Majesty, “that
they should be protected by his Majesty’s laws and justice, and enjoy
whatever God’s blessing and their honest industry had furnished them
with, and all the other privileges with his Majesty’s English subjects.”</p>

<p>The Dutch, therefore, on the 27th of August, submitted upon terms
of capitulation. The articles secured them in the enjoyment of liberty
of conscience in Divine worship, and their own mode of discipline.
The Dutch Governor and people became English subjects, enjoyed their
estates, and all the privileges of Englishmen. Upon the surrender of the
town of New Amsterdam, it was named New York, in honor of the Duke
of York.</p>

<p>Fort Orange, or Aurania, surrendered on the 24th of September, and
was named Albany, after the Duke of York and Albany. Sir Robert
Carr proceeded to the Delaware, and on the 1st of October compelled the
Dutch and Swedes to capitulate. Upon this day the whole of the New
Netherlands became subject to the crown of England.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiting, who was in Boston, and learned much of the temper
of the commissioners, was sent back in haste to give information of the
danger in which, it was apprehended, the colonies were, to advise New
Haven to incorporate with Connecticut without delay, and to make a
joint exertion for the preservation of their chartered rights. This was
pressed not only as absolutely necessary for New Haven, but for the general
safety of the country. In consequence of this intelligence a General
Court was convened at New Haven on the 11th of August, 1664. Governor
Leet communicated the intelligence he had received, and acquainted
them that Mr. Whiting and Mr. Bull, in their own name, and in behalf
of the magistrates of Connecticut, pressed their immediate subjection to
their government. The Court was certified that, after some treaty with
these gentlemen, their committee had given an answer, purporting that
if Connecticut would, in his Majesty’s name, assert their claim to the
colony of New Haven, and secure them in the full enjoyment of all the
immunities which they had proposed, and engage to make a united exertion
for the preservation of their chartered rights, they would make their
submission. After a long debate the Court resolved that, if Connecticut
should come and assist their claim, as had been agreed, they would submit
until the meeting of the commissioners of the united colonies. The
magistrates and principal gentlemen of the colony seem to have been
sensible not only of the expediency, but of the necessity, of an incorporation
with Connecticut. The opposition, however, was so general among
the people that nothing further was effected. The Court of Commissioners
was so near at hand that no further demands were made on New Haven
until their advice could be known. The General Assembly met early in
September, and passed a remonstrance against the sitting of Governor
Leet and Deputy-Governor Jones with the commissioners. In the remonstrance
they declared that New Haven was not a colony, but a part
of Connecticut, and made claim to it as such. They insisted that owning
that as a colony, distinct from Connecticut, after his Majesty had by
his letters-patent incorporated it with that colony, was inconsistent with
the king’s pleasure; would endanger the right of all the colonies, and
especially the charter-rights of Connecticut. The Assembly, at the same
time, declared that they would have a tender regard to their honored
friends and brethren at New Haven, and exert themselves to accommodate
them with all the immunities and privileges which they conveyed by
their Charter.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September the Court of Commissioners met at Hartford.
The commissioners from New Haven were allowed their seats with
the other confederates. The case of New Haven and Connecticut was
fully heard, and though the Court did not approve of the manner in which
Connecticut had proceeded, yet they earnestly pressed a speedy and
amicable union of the two colonies.</p>

<p>To remove all obstructions on their part, the commissioners recommended
it to the General Courts of Massachusetts and Plymouth, that, in
case the colony of New Haven should incorporate with Connecticut, they
might then be owned as one colony, and send two commissioners to each
meeting; and that the determinations of any four of the six should be
equally binding on the confederates as the conclusions of six out of
eight had been before. It was also proposed that the meeting, which had
been at New Haven, should be at Hartford.</p>

<p>In compliance with the advice of the commissioners, Governor Leet
convened a General Court in New Haven on the 14th of September, and
communicated the advice which had been given them to unite. They
considered whether, if the king’s commissioners should visit them,
they would not be much better able to vindicate their liberty and just
rights, in union with Connecticut under the royal patent, than in their
present circumstances; and many insisted, notwithstanding, “that we
stand; as God had kept them to that time, was their best way.” Others
were intensely of the contrary opinion, and, after a full discussion of the
subject, no vote for union or treaty could be obtained.</p>

<p>New Haven and Branford were more fixed and obstinate in their opposition
to an incorporation with Connecticut than any of the other
towns in that colony. Mr. Davenport and Mr. Pierson seem to have been
among its chief supporters. They, with many of the inhabitants of the
colony, were more rigid with respect to the terms of church-communion
than the ministers and churches of Connecticut generally were. A considerable
number of the churches in Connecticut were in favor of the
propositions of the General Council, which met at Cambridge in 1662,
relative to baptism of children whose parents were not in full communion.
The ministers and churches of New Haven were universally and
utterly against them. Mr. Davenport, and others in this colony, were
also strong in the opinion that all government should be in the Church.
No person in the colony could be a freeman unless he was a member in
full communion. But, in Connecticut, all orderly persons possessing a
freehold to a certain amount might be made free of the corporation.
Those gentlemen who were so strong in their opposition were jealous that
a union would mar the purity, order, and beauty of their churches, and
have an influence on the civil administrations. Besides, it was a painful
reflection that, after they had been at so much pains and expense to form
and support themselves as a distinct government, and had been many
years owned as one, their existence must cease and their name be
obliterated. Milford at this time broke off from them, and would
no more either send magistrates or deputies to the General Court.
Mr. Richard Law, a principal gentleman in Stamford, also deserted
them.</p>

<p>In this state of affairs the General Assembly of Connecticut convened
on the 13th of October. This was an important crisis with the colony.
Their liberties were not only in equal danger with those of the sister-colonies,
from the extraordinary powers and arbitrary dispositions and
measures of the king’s commissioners, but the Duke of York, a powerful
antagonist, had received a patent covering Long Island and all that part
of the colony west of Connecticut River. William and Anne, the Duke
and Duchess of Hamilton, had petitioned his Majesty to restore to them
the tract of country granted to their father, James, Marquis of Hamilton,
in the year 1635; and his Majesty had, on the 6th of May, 1664, referred
the case to the determination of Colonel Nichols and the other commissioners.
Besides, the state of affairs with New Haven was neither comfortable
nor safe.</p>

<p>The Legislature, to conciliate the commissioners and obtain the good
graces of his Majesty, ordered a present of five hundred bushels of corn
to be made to the commissioners. A large committee was appointed to
settle the boundaries between Connecticut and the Duke of York. A
committee, consisting of Messrs. Allen, Wyllys, Talcott, and Newburg,
was appointed to settle the boundary-line between this colony and Massachusetts,
and between Connecticut and Rhode Island. They were instructed
not to give away any part of the lands included within the
limits of the Charter.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, Mr. Allen, and the Secretary, were authorized to proceed
to New Haven, and, by order of the General Assembly, “in his Majesty’s
name to require the inhabitants of New Haven, Milford, Branford, Guilford,
and Stamford, to submit to the government established by his Majesty’s
most gracious grant to this colony, and to receive their answer.”
They were authorized to make declaration, that the Assembly did invest
Messrs. Leet, Jones, Gilbert, Fenn, Crane, Treat, and Law, with the powers
of magistracy, to govern their respective plantations agreeably to the laws
of Connecticut, or such of their own laws as were not inconsistent with
the Charter, until their session in May next.</p>

<p>The gentlemen appointed to this service on the 19th of November
went to New Haven, and proceeded according to their instructions.</p>

<p>About this time Governor Winthrop, Mr. Allen, Mr. Gould, Mr.
Richards, and John Winthrop, the committee appointed to settle the
boundaries between Connecticut and New York, waited upon the commissioners
on York Island. After they had been fully heard in behalf
of Connecticut, the commissioners determined “that the southern boundary
of his Majesty’s colony of Connecticut is the sea; and that Long
Island is to be under the government of the Duke of York, as is expressed
in plain words in the said patents respectively. We also order
and declare, that the creek or river called Mamaroneck, which is reputed
to be almost twelve miles to the east of West Chester, and a line drawn
from the east point or side, where the fresh water falls into the salt, at
high-water mark, north-northwest to the line of Massachusetts, be the
western bounds of said colony of Connecticut; and the plantations lying
westward of that creek, and a line so drawn, to be under his Royal
Highness’s government; and all plantations lying eastward of the creek
and line to be under the government of Connecticut.”</p>

<p>In consequence of the acts of Connecticut, and the determination of
the commissioners relative to the boundaries of the colony, a General
Court was called at New Haven on the 13th of December, 1664, and the
following resolutions were unanimously passed:</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> “That by this act or vote we be not understood to justify Connecticut’s
former actings, nor anything disorderly done by their own people,
on such accounts.</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> “That by it we be not apprehended to have any hand in breaking
and dissolving the confederation.</p>

<p class="blockquote hanging"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> “Yet, in loyalty to the king’s Majesty, when an authentic copy
of the determination of his Majesty’s commissioners is published, to be
recorded with us, if thereby it shall appear to our committee that we
are, by his Majesty’s authority, now put under Connecticut patent, we
shall submit, by a necessity brought upon us by the means of Connecticut
aforesaid, but with a <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">solvo jure</span> of our former rights and claims, as a
people who have not yet been heard in point of plea.”—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_25"><span class="muchsmaller">[25]</span></a>
 While the churches were thus divided, they were alarmed by the
appearance of the Quakers. A number of them arrived in Boston in
July and August, and had been committed to the common gaol. A great
number of their books had been seized with the view to burn them. In
consequence of their arrival, and the disturbance they had made in Boston,
the commissioners of the united colonies, at their court in September,
recommended it to the several General Courts,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“That all Quakers, Ranters, and other notorious heretics, should be
prohibited coming into the united colonies; and that, if they should come
or arise among them, they should be forthwith secured and removed
out of all the jurisdictions.”</p>

<p>In conformity with this recommendation, the General Court of Connecticut,
in October, passed the following act:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“That no town within this jurisdiction shall entertain any Quakers,
Ranters, Adamites, or such like notorious heretics, or suffer them to
continue in them above the space of fourteen days, upon the penalty
of 5<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per week for any town entertaining such persons. But the townsmen
shall give notice to the two next magistrates or assistants, who
shall have the power to send them to prison, for securing them until
they can conveniently be sent out of the jurisdiction. It is also ordered
that no master of a vessel shall land any such heretics; but if they do,
they shall be compelled to transport them again out of the colony, by
any two magistrates or assistants, at their first setting sail from the port
where they landed them; during which time the assistant or magistrate
shall see them secured, upon the penalty of 20<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> for any master of any
vessel that shall not transport them as aforesaid.”—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_26"><span class="muchsmaller">[26]</span></a>
 Mr. Dudley, while president of the commissioners, had written to
the Governor and Company, advising them to resign the Charter into the
hands of his Majesty, and promising to use his influence in favor of the
colony. Mr. Dudley’s commission was suspended by a commission to Sir
Edmund Andros to be Governor of New England. He arrived in Boston
on the 19th of December, 1686. The next day his commission was published,
and he took on him the administration of the government. Soon
after his arrival he wrote to the Governor and Company that he had a
commission from his Majesty to receive their Charter, if they would resign
it; and he pressed them, in obedience to the king, and as they would
give him an opportunity to serve them, to resign it to his pleasure. At
this session of the Assembly the Governor received another letter from
him, acquainting him that he was assured, by the advice he had received
from England, that judgment was by that time entered upon the <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span>
against their Charter, and that he soon expected to receive his
Majesty’s commands respecting them. He urged them, as he represented
it, that he might not be wanting in serving their welfare, to accept his
Majesty’s favor, so graciously offered them, in a present compliance and
surrender. But the colony insisted upon their Charter rights, and on the
promise of King James, as well as of his royal brother, to defend and
secure them in the enjoyment of their privileges and estates, and would
not surrender their Charter to either. However, in their petition to the
king, in which they prayed for the continuance of their Charter rights,
they desired, if this could not be obtained, but it should be resolved to
put them under another government, that it might be under Sir Edmund’s,
as the Massachusetts had been their former correspondents and confederates,
and as they were acquainted with their principles and manners.</p>

<p>This was construed into a resignation, though nothing could be further
from the designs of the colony.</p>

<p>The Assembly met, as usual, in October, and the government continued
according to the Charter, until the last of the month.</p>

<p>About this time Sir Edmund and his suite, and more than sixty regular
troops, came to Hartford, where the Assembly were sitting, and demanded
the Charter, and declared the government under it dissolved.
The Assembly were extremely reluctant and slow with respect to any
resolve to surrender the Charter, or with respect to any motion to bring
it forth. The tradition is, that Governor Treat represented the great expense
and hardships of the colonists in planting the country; the blood
and treasure which they had expended in defending it, both against the
savages and foreigners; to what hardships and dangers he himself had
been exposed for that purpose; and that it was like giving up his life
now to surrender the patent and privileges so dearly bought and so long
enjoyed. The important affair was debated and kept in suspense until
the evening, when the Charter was brought and laid upon the table where
the Assembly was sitting. By this time a great number of people were
assembled, and men sufficiently bold to enterprise whatever might be
necessary or expedient.</p>

<p>The lights were instantly extinguished, and one Captain Wadsworth,
of Hartford, in the most silent and secret manner, carried off the Charter
and secreted it in a large, hollow tree, fronting the house of the Hon.
Samuel Wyllys, then one of the magistrates of the colony. The people
appeared all peaceable and orderly. The candles were relighted, but the
patent was gone, and no discovery could be made of it or of the person
who had conveyed it away.</p>

<p>It was said that the Charter was delivered up, and that same evening
the apartments of Sir Edmund were entered and the patent abstracted;
but this does not appear to have been the case. Sir Edmund assumed
the government, and the records of the colony were closed in the following
words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“At a General Court at Hertford, October 31, 1687, His Excellency
Sir Edmund Andros, Knight, and Captain-General, and Governor, of his
Majesty’s territories and dominions in New England, by order from his
Majesty James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, the
31st of October, 1687, took into his hands the government of the Colony
of Connecticut, it being by his Majesty annexed to Massachusets and
other colonies under his Excellency’s government.</p>

<p class="blockquote quotesig">“FINIS.”</p>

<p>Sir Edmund appointed officers civil and military. His Council at first
consisted of forty persons, and afterward of nearly fifty. Four among
the number—Governor Treat, John Fitz Winthrop, Wait Winthrop, and
John Allen, Esquires—were of Connecticut.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_27"><span class="muchsmaller">[27]</span></a>
 Scarcely anything could be more gloomy and distressful than the
state of public affairs in New England at the beginning of this year.
But in the midst of darkness light arose. While the people had prayed
in vain to an earthly monarch, their petition had been more successfully
presented to a higher throne. Providence wrought gloriously for them
and the nation’s deliverance. On the 5th of November, 1688, the Prince
of Orange landed at Torbay, in England. He immediately published a
declaration of his design in visiting the kingdom. A copy of this was
received at Boston by one Mr. Winslow, a gentleman from Virginia, in
April, 1689.</p>

<p>Governor Andros and his Council were so much alarmed with the news,
that they ordered Mr. Winslow to be arrested and committed to jail for
bringing a false and traitorous libel in the country.</p>

<p>They also issued a proclamation commanding all the officers and people
to be in readiness to prevent the landing of any forces which the
Prince of Orange might send into that part of America. But the people,
who sighed under their burdens, secretly wished and prayed for success
to his glorious undertaking. The leaders in the country determined quietly
to await the event; but the great body of the people had less patience.
Stung with past injuries, and encouraged at the first intimations
of relief, the fire of liberty rekindled, and the flame, which for a long time
had been smothered in their bosoms, burst forth with irresistible violence.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April the inhabitants of Boston and the adjacent towns
rose in arms, made themselves masters of the castle, seized Sir Edmund
Andros and his Council, and persuaded the old Governor and Council at
Boston to resume the government.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, 1689, Governor Robert Treat, Deputy-Governor
James Bishop, and the former magistrates, at the desire of the freemen,
resumed the government of Connecticut. Major-General John Winthrop
was at the same time chosen into the magistracy, to complete the number
appointed by the Charter.</p>

<p>The freemen voted that, for the present safety of that part of New
England called Connecticut, the necessity of its circumstances so requiring,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“They would reëstablish government as it was before and at the time
Sir Edmund Andros took it, and so have it proceed, as it did before that
time, according to charter, engaging themselves to submit to it accordingly,
until there should be a legal establishment among them.”</p>

<p>The Assembly, having formed, came to the following resolutions:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“That, whereas this Court hath been interrupted in the management
of its government, in this Colony of Connecticut, for nineteen months
past, it is now enacted, ordered, and declared, that all the laws of this
colony, made according to Charter, and courts constituted for the administration
of government, as they were before the late interruption, shall
be of full force and virtue for the future, and until this Court shall see
cause to make further and other alterations, according to the Charter.”</p>

<p>The Assembly then confirmed all military officers in their respective
posts, and proceeded to appoint their civil officers, as had been customary
at the May session.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 “<span class="smaller">AN ADDRESS TO KING WILLIAM, JUNE 18, 1689.</span></p>

<p class="hanging">“<span class="sc">To the King’s Most Excellent Majesty</span>: The humble address of your
Majesty’s dutiful and loyal subjects, the Governor and Company of
your Majesty’s Colony of Connecticut, in New England.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Great Sovereign</span>: Great was that day when the Lord, who sitteth
upon the floods, and sitteth King forever, did divide his and your adversaries
from one another, like the waters of Jordan forced to stand upon an
heap, and did begin to magnify you, like Joshua in the sight of all Israel,
by those great actions that were so much for the honour of God and the
deliverance of the English dominions from popery and slavery; and all
this, separated from those sorrows that usually attend the introduction of
a peaceable settlement in any troubled state: all which doth affect us
with the sense of our duty to return the highest praise unto the King of
Kings and Lord of Hosts, and bless him who hath delighted in you, to set
you upon the throne of his Israel, and to say, Because the Lord loved
Israel forever, therefore has he made you king, to do justice and judgment,
&amp;c.; also humble and hearty acknowledgement for the great zeal
that by your Majesty has been expressed in those hazards you have put
your royal person to, and in the expense of so great a treasure in the
defense of the Protestant interest. In the consideration of all which, we,
your Majesty’s dutiful and loyal subjects of your said colony, are encouraged
humbly to intimate that we, with much favour, obtained a Charter
from Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, of happy memory, bearing date April 23, 1662, in
the fourteenth year of his reign, granted to the Governor and Company
of his Majesty’s Colony of Connecticut, the advantages and privileges
whereof made us indeed a very happy people; and, by the blessing of God
upon our endeavours, we have made a considerable improvement of your
dominions here, which, with the defense of ourselves from the force of
both foreign and intestine enemies, has cost us much expense of treasure
and blood; yet in the second year of the reign of his late Majesty, King
James <span class="sc"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>, we had a <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span> served upon us by Edward Randolph,
requiring our appearance before his Majesty’s court in England; and although
the time of our appearance was elapsed before the serving the
said <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span>, yet we humbly petitioned his Majesty for his favour and
the continuance of our Charter, with the privileges thereof; but we received
no other favour but a second <span class="sc">quo warranto</span>: and we well observed
that the Charter of London, and of other considerable cities in England,
were condemned, and that the Charter of Massachusets had undergone
the like fate, plainly saw what we might expect; yet as we not judged it
good or lawful to be active in surrendering what had cost us so dear, nor
to be altogether silent, we employed an attorney to appear in our behalf,
and to prefer our humble address to his Majesty, to entreat his favour
quickly upon it; but as Sir Edmund Andros informed us he was empowered
by his Majesty to regain the surrender of our Charter, if we saw
meet to do so, and to take ourselves under his government, we withstood
all these motions, and in our reiterated addresses we petitioned his Majesty
to continue us in the full and free enjoyment of our liberties and
property, civil and sacred, according to our Charter. We also petitioned
that if his Majesty should not see meet to continue us as we were, but
was resolved to annex us to some other government, we then desired that
(inasmuch as Boston had been our old correspondents, and people whose
principles and manners we had been acquainted with) we might be annexed
rather to Sir Edmund Andros his government than to Colonel
Dungan’s, which choice of ours was taken for a resignation of our government;
though that was never intended by us for such, nor had it the
formalities in law to make it a resignation, as we humbly conceive; yet
Sir Edmund Andros was commissioned by his Majesty to take us under
his government: pursuant to which, about the end of October, 1687, he,
with a company of gentlemen and grenadiers to the number of sixty or
upward, came to Hertford (the chief seat of this government), caused

and put into commission both civil and military officers through our colony,
as he pleased, when he passed through the principal parts thereof.</p>

<p>“The good people of the colony, though they were under a great sense
of injuries they sustained hereby, yet chose rather to be silent and patient
than oppose, being, indeed, surprised into an involuntary submission to
an arbitrary power; but when the government we were thus put under
seemed to us to be determined, and we being in daily fear and hazard of
those many inconveniences that will arise from a people in want of a government;
being also in continual danger of our lives by reason of the natives
being at war with us, with whom we had just fears of our neighbouring
French to join, not receiving any order or directions what method to
take for our security, we were necessitated to put ourselves into some
form of government; and there being none so familiar to us as that of our
Charter, nor what we could make so effectual for the gaining the universal
compliance of the people, and having never received any intimation
of an enrolment of that which was interpreted a resignation of our Charter,
we have presumed, by the consent of the major part of the freemen
assembled for that end, May 9, 1689, to resume our government according
to the rules of our Charter, and this to continue till further order; yet, as
we have thus presumed to dispose ourselves, not waiting orders from your
Majesty, we humbly submit ourselves herein, entreating your Majesty’s
most gracious pardon; and that what our urgent necessity hath put upon
us may no ways interrupt your Majesty’s grace and favour toward us, your
most humble and dutiful subjects, but that in your clemency you would
be pleased to grant us such directions as to your princely wisdom may
seem meet, with such ratifications and confirmations of our Charter, in the
full and free enjoyment of all our properties, privileges, and liberties, both
civil and sacred, as therein granted to us by your royal predecessor, King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, which may yet further insure it an inheritance to us and our
posterities after us, with what further grace and favour your royal and enlarged
heart may be moved to confer upon us; which, we trust, we shall
not forget nor be unprofitable under; but as we have this day, with the
greatest expressions of joy, proclaimed your Majesty and Royal Consort
King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, with the dominions
hereto belonging, so we shall ever pray that God would grant your Majesties
long life, and prosperously to reign over all your dominions, and that
the great and happy work you have begun may be prospered here, and
graciously rewarded with a crown of glory hereafter.</p>

 Dr. Douglas was a naturalist, and a physician of considerable eminence
in Boston, where he never attended any religious worship, having
been educated in Scotland with such rancorous hatred against episcopacy,
that, with his age, it ripened into open scepticism and deism. However,
his many severities against the Episcopalians, New Lights, and Quakers,
procured him a good name among the Old Lights, and the mongrel christians
of New-York, whose policy and self-interest have always domineered
over conscience and morality. For these reasons, his brother Smith, in
his History of New-York, frequently quotes him, to prove his futile assertions
against New-England, New-Jersey, and Pensylvania.</p>

quit-rent payable to the Crown in New-York is 2<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 6<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> per 100 acres, but
only 9<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> in Newhampshire. The same may be said, with still more reason,

 In 1680, the number of Indians, or aborigines, in the whole Province
of Connecticut was 4000. This was allowed by the General Assembly.
How much greater their number was in 1637, may be estimated
from the accounts given by Dr. Mather, Mr. Neal, Mr. Penhallow, and
Mr. Hutchinson, of the deaths of Englishmen in the Indian wars, for the
space of forty-three years. It has been computed, that from 1637 to
1680, upon an average, one hundred Englishmen were killed yearly in
those wars, and that there were killed, with sword and gun, and smallpox,
twenty Indians for every one Englishman. If this calculation is
just, it appears that the English killed of the Indians, during the above-mentioned
period, 86,000, to which number the 4000 Indians remaining
in 1680 being added, it is clear that there were 90,000 Indians in Connecticut
when Hooker began his holy war upon them; not to form conjectures
upon those who probably afterwards abandoned the country.
This evinces the weakness of the Indian mode of fighting with bows and
arrows against guns, and the impropriety of calling Connecticut an howling
wilderness in 1636, when Hooker arrived in Hertford. The English
in one hundred and thirty-six years have not much more than doubled
the number of Indians they killed in forty-three years. In 1770 the
number of Indians in Connecticut amounted not to 400 souls.</p>

 Many years afterward the author’s attention was called to this
statement; he replied, as to the expression above, by saying, he meant
that the pressure of the stream was so great that a crowbar, not having
sufficient specific gravity to sink, would actually be carried down the
stream upon its surface. As incredulous as this may appear, we have
it substantiated by no less a person than the late eminent engineer, John
A. Roebling, who built the suspension-bridge over the river at the Niagara
Falls, in the following letter:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: I received a copy of <cite>The Democrat</cite>, with your account
of my attempting to sound the river. After you left, another attempt was
made, with a similar iron, of about forty pounds’ weight, attached to a
No. 11 wire, all freely suspended, so as not to impede the fall of the
weight. I then let the weight fall from the bridge, a height of 225 feet.
It struck the surface fairly, with the point down—must have sunk to
some depth, but was not longer out of sight than one second, when it
made its appearance again upon the surface, about 100 feet down stream,
and skipped along like a chip, until it was checked by the wire. We
then commenced hauling in slowly, which made the iron bounce like a
ball, when a cake of ice struck it, and ended the sport.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I am satisfied that no metal has sufficient gravity to pierce that
current, even with the momentum acquired by a fall of 226 feet. The
velocity of the iron, when striking, must have been about equal to 124
feet per second, and, consequently, its momentum near 5,000 pounds.
Its surface, opposed to the current, was about fifty superficial inches.
This will give an idea of the strength of that current, and, at the same
time, hint at the Titan forces that have been at work to scoop out the
bed of the Niagara River.</p>

 Of the separation from the standing churches an account has been
given, and of the disorders and oppressions of those times when they
commenced. Churches of this character were formed in New London,
Stonington, Preston, Norwich, Lyme, Canterbury, Plainfield, Windsor,
Suffield, and Middletown. Some of these churches and congregations
were nearly as large as some of the standing churches. There were ten
or twelve churches and congregations of this denomination, first and last,
in the colony. Some of them carried their enthusiasm to a greater extent
than others. In New London they carried it to such a degree that
they made a large fire to burn their books, clothes, and ornaments, which
they called their idols, and which they now determined to forsake, and
utterly to put away.</p>

<p>This imaginary work of piety and self-denial they undertook on the
Lord’s-day, and brought their books, necklaces, and jewels, together in
the main street.</p>

<p>They began by burning their erroneous books, dropping them, one
after another, into the fire, pronouncing these words: “If the author of
this book died in the same sentiments and faith in which he wrote it, as
the smoke of this pile ascends, so the smoke of his torment will ascend
forever and ever. Hallelujah! Amen.”</p>

<p>But they were prevented from burning their clothes and jewels. John
Lee, of Lyme, told them his idols were his wife and children, and that he
could not burn them; it would be contrary to the laws of God and man;
that it was impossible to destroy idolatry without a change of heart and
of the affections.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Dean went to England and took orders for the church
at Hebron, but died at sea on his return, about the year 1745. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mr. Punderson, of Groton, then preached to them, and administered the
sacrament, from 1746 to 1752. The people of Hebron were very unfortunate
with respect to the gentlemen who went to England for orders in
their behalf. A Mr. Cotton, in 1752, received orders for them, but he
died, on his passage for New-England, with the small-pox. Mr. Graves, of
New-London, served them from 1752 to 1757. In 1757 one Mr. Usher
went for orders in their behalf; he was taken by the French, on his
passage to England, and died in captivity.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters was ordained their priest in August, 1759,

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Mr. Printer</span>: You have shewn no partiality in your paper among
contending parties, but have given all rational systems, at least all popular
plans, a chance in the world by your medeocritical channel. What
I am desirous of communicating to the public is very popular: It is, to
put the Quacks Club in the East upon a reputible footing, as the licensed
Physiognomers in the West.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“At a meeting held in Connecticut, October, 1767, it was resolved:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“First: We Etiologists, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> John Whiggot, Esq. President, Adam
Kuncnow, Michel Nugnug, Shazael Bulldunce, Committee for said Club

appointed a meeting to be upon the first Tuesday of every month, for
the year ensueing, at the house of Mr. Abram Bruntick, in Green Lane,
nigh the Crow Market, straight forward from the sign of the Goose, at
the sign of the Looking Glass.</p>

 The episcopal church in Stratford is the oldest of that denomination
in the State. But episcopacy made very little progress in Connecticut,
until after the declaration of Rector Cutler, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Whitemore,
and Mr. Brown, for episcopacy, in 1722. Numbers of Mr. Johnson’s
and Mr. Whitemore’s hearers professed episcopacy with them, and set up
the worship of God, according to the manner of the Church of England,
in the West and North-Haven. Mr. (afterward Dr.) Johnson was a
gentleman distinguished for literature, of popular talents and engaging
manners. In 1724, after receiving episcopal ordination in England, he
returned to Stratford, and, under his ministry to that and the neighboring
churches of that denomination, they were increased.—<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor's">Ed.</abbr> Note.</span></p>

 An early provision was therefore made by law in Massachusetts and
Connecticut for the support of the ministry. In Connecticut all persons
were obliged by law to contribute to the support of the Church as well as
of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>All rates respecting the support of ministers, or any ecclesiastical
affairs, were to be made and collected in the same manner as the rates
of the respective towns.</p>

<p>Special care was taken that all persons should attend the means of
public instruction. The law obliged them to be present at public worship
on the Lord’s-day, and upon all days of public fasting and praying, and
of thanksgivings appointed by civil authority, on penalty of a fine of
five shillings for every instance of neglect. The Congregational churches
were adopted and established by law; but provision was made that all
sober, orthodox persons dissenting from them should, upon the manifestation
of it to the General Court, be allowed peaceably to worship in their
own way.</p>

<p>It was enacted, “That no person within this Colony shall in any wise
embody themselves into Church estate without consent of the General
Court and approbation of neighbouring elders.”</p>

<p>The law also prohibited that any ministry or Church administration
should be entertained or attended by the inhabitants of any plantation in
the Colony, distinct and separate from, and in opposition to, that which
was openly and publicly observed and dispensed by the approved minister
of the place; except it was by the approbation of the Court and
neighboring churches. The penalty for every breach of this act was

 The following will show that a Connecticut mob of <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>
is not inferior to a London mob of drunken Conformists, either in point
of ingenuity, low humour, or religious mockery. The stamp-master was
declared by the mob at Hertford to be dead. The mob at Lebanon undertook
to send Ingersoll to his own place. They made their effigies,
one to represent Mr. Grenville, another Ingersoll, and a third the devil.
The last was dressed with a wig, hat, and black coat, given by parson
Solomon Williams, of Lebanon. Mr. Grenville was honoured with a hat,
wig, and coat, a present from Mr. Jonathan Trumbull, who was afterwards
 chosen Governor, (and who afterwards wrote the letter to General Gage, as
appears in a preceding note.) Mr. Ingersoll was dressed in red, with a
lawyer’s wig, a wooden sword, and his hat under his arm, by the generosity
of Joseph Trumbull. Thus equipped, the effigies were put into a cart,
with ropes about their necks, and drawn towards the gallows. A dialogue
ensued between the criminals. Some friendship seemed to subsist between
Mr. Grenville and the devil, while nothing but sneers and frowns
passed the devil to Ingersoll; and the fawning reverence of the latter
gave his infernal Highness such offence, that he turned up his breech
and discharged fire, brimstone, and tar in Ingersoll’s face, setting him all
in a blaze; which, however, Mr. Grenville generously extinguished with a
squirt. This was many times repeated. As the procession advanced,
the mob exclaimed, “Behold the just reward of our agent, who sold himself
to Grenville, like Judas, at a price!” In this manner the farce
was continued till midnight, at which time they arrived at the gallows;
where a person in a long shirt, in derision of the surplice of a Church
clergyman, addressed the criminals with republican Atticisms, railleries,
&amp;c., concluding thus: “May your deaths be tedious and intolerable, and
may your souls sink quick down to hell, the residence of tyrants, traitors,
and devils!” The effigies were then turned off, and, after hanging
some time, were hoisted upon a huge pile of wood and burnt, that
their bodies might share a similar fate with their souls. This pious transaction
exalted the character of Mr. Trumbull, and facilitated his election
to the office of Governor; and, what was of further advantage to him,
his mob judged that the bones of Ingersoll’s effigy merited christian
burial according to the rites of the Church of England, though he had
been brought up a <span class="title">Sober Dissenter</span>, and resolved, therefore, to bury
his bones in Hebron. Accordingly, thither they repaired, and, after having
made a coffin, dug a grave in a cross-street, and made every other
preparation for the interment, they sent for the episcopal clergyman
there to attend the funeral of the bones of Ingersoll the traitor.</p>

<p>The clergyman<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
told the messengers that neither his office nor his
person were to be sported with, nor was it his business to bury <span class="title">Sober
Dissenters</span> who abuse the Church while living. The mob, enraged at this
answer, ordered a party to bring the clergyman by force, or send him to
hell after Ingersoll. This alarmed the people of the town, who instantly
loaded their muskets in defence of the clergyman. Thus checked in
their mad career, the mob contented themselves with a solemn funeral
procession, drums beating and horns blowing, and buried the coffin in
the cross-street, one of the pantomimes bawling out, “We commit this
traitor’s bones to the earth—ashes to dust and dust to ashes—in sure
and certain hope that his soul is in hell with all tories and enemies in
Zion.” Then, having driven a stake through the coffin, and each cast
a stone upon the grave, they broke a few windows, cursed such clergymen
as rode in chaises and were above the control of God’s people, and went
off with a witless saying, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “It is better to live with the Church militant
than with the Church triumphant.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> preceding sheets bring the “History of Connecticut” to
its latest period of amity with Great Britain, agreeable to the
plan upon which it was begun. I propose laying before my
readers, in an Appendix, a summary account of the proceedings
of the people of Connecticut immediately leading to their open
hostilities against the Mother Country, not only because some
events are not at all, or erroneously, known here, but also because
they will form a supplement necessary in several instances to
what has been already related. Another reason that induces me
to make the proposed addition is, the contradictions that have so
frequently appeared regarding the statements made by the author
of the “History,” as to acts and laws that were in force in the
colony of Connecticut during its early settlement, and which had
been handed down to their posterity by the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, as
they called themselves, many of which laws remained in force up
to the beginning of the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Mr. James Hammond Trumbull, a descendant of Governor
Trumbull, so frequently spoken of in this work and notes, in a
book lately published by him, entitled “The True Blue Laws of
Connecticut and Newhaven, and the False Blue Laws invented
by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters,” has taken unnecessary pains to
show that the Blue Laws represented in the “History” were never
published in the colony, and consequently must be factitious.
The author of the “History” himself mentions that they never
were published; and had Mr. Trumbull referred to the action of
the meeting of the planters in Quinnipiack, the 4th of June, 1639,
<!--247.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>
he would have seen that the general resolutions then and there
adopted were to be their laws, and that no laws were enacted.
(See Note on pages <a href="#footnote_15">44-47</a>.)</p>

<p>Many writers have endeavoured to point out the motive which
prompted the Americans to the wish of being independent of
Great Britain, who had for a century and a half nursed and protected
them with parental tenderness; but they have only touched
upon the reasons ostensibly held up by the Americans, but which
are merely a veil to the true causes. These, therefore, I shall endeavour
to set before the reader.</p>

<p>In the first place: England, as if afraid to venture her Constitution
in America, had kept it at an awful distance, and established
in many of her colonies republicanism, wherein the democratic
absorbs the regal and aristocratic part of the English Constitution.
The people naturally imbibed the idea that they were superior to
kings and lords, because they controlled their representatives,
governors, and councils. This is the infallible consequence of
popular governments.</p>

<p>Secondly: The English had, like the Dutch, adopted the errors
of ancient Rome, who judged that her colonies could be held in
subjection only by natives of Rome; and therefore all emoluments
were carefully withheld from all natives of the colonies.</p>

<p>Thirdly: The learned and opulent families in America were
not honoured by their King like those born in Britain.</p>

<p>Fourthly: The Americans saw themselves despised by the
Britons, “though bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh.”
They felt and complained of, without redress, the sad effects of
convicts, the curses of human society and the disgrace of England,
taken from the dungeons, jails, and gibbets, and poured into
America as the common sewer of England, to murder, plunder,
and commit outrage upon the people “whom the King did not
delight to honour.”</p>

<p>Hence the rebellion. Human nature is always such that men
will never cease struggling for honour, wealth, and power, at the
expense of gratitude, loyalty, and virtue.</p>

<p>Indignation and despair seized the gentlemen in America, who
thought, like Haman, that their affluence and ease was nothing
<!--248.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>
worth so long as they lay under the sovereign’s contempt. They
declared that the insult reached the whole continent, in which
were to be found only two Baronets of Great Britain, while all
the other inhabitants were held beneath the yeomanry of England.
They added: “Let Cæsar tremble! Let wealth and private
property depart, to deliver our country from the injuries of our
elder brethren!” How easily might the rebellion have been
averted by the granting of titles! With what reason faction and
discontent spring up in South-America, may be learned from the
dear-bought wisdom of Spain, who transported to her colonies
her own Constitution in Church and State, rewarded merit in
whatever part of her territories it appeared, sent bishops to govern
and ordain in every church in South-America, and they, together
with the native <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</span>, promoted harmony, the offspring
of justice and policy; while North-America abounded with discord,
hatred, and rebellion, entirely from want of policy and justice
in their party-coloured charters, and of the honours and
privileges of natural-born subjects of Great Britain.</p>

<p>It appears that the British Government, in the last century,
did not expect New-England to remain under their authority;
nor did the New-Englanders consider themselves as subjects, but
allies, of Great Britain. It seems that England’s intent was to
afford an asylum to the republicans, who had been a scourge to
the British Constitution; and so, to encourage that restless party
to emigrate, republican charters were granted, and privileges and
promises given them far beyond what any Englishman in England
was entitled to. The emigrants were empowered to make
laws in Church and State, agreeable to their own will and pleasure,
without the King’s approbation; they were excused from all
quit-rents, all Government taxes, and promised protection without
paying homage to the British King, and their children entitled to
the same rights and privileges as if born in England. However
hard this bargain was upon the side of England, she had performed
her part, except in the last respect—indeed, the most
material in policy and in the minds of the principal gentlemen of
New-England. The honour of nobility had not been conferred
on any of them, and therefore they had never enjoyed the full
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>
privileges and liberties of the Britons, but, in a degree, had ever
been held in bondage under their chartered republican systems,
wherein gentlemen of learning and property attain not to equal
power with the peasants. The people of New-England were
rightly styled republicans; but a distinction should be made between
the learned and the unlearned, the rich and the poor. The
latter formed a great majority; therefore the minority were
obliged to wear the livery of the majority, in order to secure
their election into office. These very republican gentlemen were
ambitious, fond of the power of governing, and grudged no
money or pains to obtain an annual office. What would they not
have given for a dignity depending not on the fickle will of a
multitude, but on the steady reason and generosity of a king?
The merchants, lawyers, and clergy, to appearance were republicans,
but not one of them was really so. The truth is, they
found necessity on the one hand, and British neglect on the other,
to be so intolerable, that they rather chose to risk their lives and
fortunes to bring about a revolution, than continue in the situation
they were. As to the multitude, they had no cause of complaint:
they were accuser, judge, king, and subjects, only to themselves.</p>

<p>The rebellion sprung not from them, but from the merchants,
lawyers, and clergy, who were never inimical to the aristocratic
branch of the Government, provided they were admitted to share
in it according to their merits. It is true, they, like Calvin, the
author of their religion, maintained that no man can merit anything
of the Great Eternal; nevertheless, they thought they had
merited the aristocratic honours which emanate from earthly
kings; while kings and nobles of the earth imagine themselves to
have merited more than they yet enjoy—even heaven itself—only
because they happen to enjoy the honour of being descendants
of heroic ancestors.</p>

<p>England had also been as careful to keep to herself her religion
and bishops as her civil constitutions and baronies. A million of
Churchmen in America had been considered as not worthy of one
bishop, while eight millions in South-Britain were scarcely honoured
with enough with twenty-six: an insult on common justice,
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>
which would have extinguished every spark of affection in America
for the English Church, and created an everlasting schism,
like that between Constantinople and Rome, had not the majority
of the American episcopal clergy been possessed of less ambition
than love and zeal. They had suffered on both sides of the Atlantic
in name and property, for their endeavours to keep up a
union between the Mother Country and her children; but all their
arguments and persuasions were insufficient to convince their
brethren that England would in future be more generous towards
her colonies. One of the first fruits of the grand continental
meeting of dissenting divines at Newhaven was a coalition between
the republican and the minor part of the episcopal clergy,
who were soon joined by the merchants, lawyers, and planters,
with a view of procuring titles, ordination, and government, independent
of Great Britain. Such were the real sources of the
rebellion in America. The invasion of this or that colonial right,
the oppression of this or that act of Parliament, were merely the
pretended causes of it, which the ill-humour of a misgoverned people
prompted them eagerly to hold up—causes which would never
have found existence, whose existence had never been necessary,
if a better system of American policy had been adopted; but, being
produced, the shadow of complaint was exhibited instead of the
substance, pretence instead of reality. Every republican pulpit resounded
with invectives against the King, Lords, and Commons,
who claimed a power to tax and govern the people of America—a
power which their charters and ancestors knew nothing of.
“Britons,” they said, “call our property theirs; they consider us
as slaves—as hewers of wood and drawers of water to the descendants
of those tyrants of Church and State who in the last
century expelled and persecuted our fathers into the wilds of
America. We have charters sacred as Magna Charta and the
Bill of Rights.”</p>

<p>They declared that the liberties of America ought to be defended
with the blood of millions; that the Attorney-General
ought to impeach the Parliament of Great Britain, and all its abettors,
of high treason, for daring to tax the freemen of America;
that each colony was a palatinate, and the people a palatine; that
<!--251.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>
the people of Connecticut had as much authority to issue a writ
of <span class="latin" lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span> against Magna Charta, as the King had to order
such a writ against the Charter of Connecticut.</p>

<p>By ravings of this kind did the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> manifest their
discontents, when the various measures for raising a revenue in
America were adopted by the British ministry. That of sending
tea to America, in 1773, subject to a duty of three pence on the
pound, payable in America, particularly excited their clamour, as
designed, they said, to establish a precedent of British taxation
in this country; and, notwithstanding all the remonstrances of
the loyalists, who strenuously exerted themselves in removing vulgar
prejudices and procuring a reconciliation with circumstances
rendered unavoidable by the necessity cf the times, they effectually
inflamed the minds of the populace by reading, in the meetings
on Sunday, letters said to have been sent by Dr. Franklin, I.
Temple, and others, representing the danger of paying any tax
imposed by Parliament, and the evil protestantism was threatened
with by a Roman Catholic King, by Jacobites, tories, and episcopal
clergy in both countries, all enemies to liberty and the American
Vine; and adding that, if the Americans paid the tax on tea,
there were three hundred other taxes ready to be imposed upon
them, one of which was “50<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> for every son born in wedlock, to
maintain the natural children of the lords and bishops of England.”</p>

<p>The moderate counsel of the loyalists had formerly been attended
with some effect; but it was forced to give place to the ribaldry
just mentioned, and an opposition much more resolute was determined
upon against the tea-act than had been made to the Stamp
Act.</p>

<p>A provincial congress, committee of correspondence, committee
of safety, in every town, &amp;c. &amp;c. now started up for the
purpose of setting the colony in an uproar against the Parliament
of Great Britain. To this end contributed not a little the falsehoods
and artifices of Mr. Handcock, and other Boston merchants,
who had in their storehouses nearly 40,000 half-boxes of tea, smuggled
from the Dutch; which would never have been sold had the
Company’s teas been once admitted into America, as the latter
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>
were not only the better in quality, but, the duty being reduced
from one shilling to three pence, would be also the much cheaper
commodity. Mr. Handcock and his compatriots, therefore, were
by no means wanting in endeavours to procure for the first teas
which arrived in New-England the reception they met with in
the harbour of Boston.</p>

<p>That famous exploit afforded them an opportunity of clearing
their warehouses, which they prudently resolved to do as soon as
possible, lest the reception of the Company’s tea in other provinces,
or other possible circumstances, should afterwards put it out of
their power. An idea began to prevail that a non-importation
of tea was an advisable measure upon the present occasion; accordingly,
they advertised that, after disposing of their present
stock, they would not import or have any further dealings in tea
for two years. This at once tended to fill their pockets, and exalt
their characters as patriots.</p>

<p>The people, ignorant of the extent of such stock, and apprehensive
of being deprived of an article they were so passionately
fond of, eagerly furnished themselves with quantities sufficient for
that time, mostly of about thirty, forty, and fifty pounds, notwithstanding
the prices were advanced one shilling per pound,
upon the pretence of raising money to pay for the tea destroyed,
in order to secure the religion and liberty of America, which, under
that idea, it was generally acknowledged ought to be done.
When the tea was mostly disposed of, the people found that the extra
price they had given for it was designed for the venders, instead
of for the East-India Company, whose tea at the bottom of the harbour
was not to be paid for. They murmured; whereupon the
smugglers voted that they would not drink any more tea, but burn
on the Common what they had left. Some tea was disposed of, and
the public-spirited transaction blazoned in the newspapers. But
this was not all: the smugglers sent letters to the leaders of mobs
in the country, enjoining them to wait upon the purchasers of their
tea, and compel them to burn it, as a proof of their patriotism.
Those honourable instructions were obeyed, to the real grievance
of the holders of the tea. “Let Mr. Handcock,” said they, “and
the other merchant-smugglers, return us our money, and then
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>
you shall be welcome to burn the tea according to their
orders.”</p>

<p>But it signified nothing to dispute the equity of the requisition;
the cry was, “Join, or die!” Nor would the Sons of Liberty be
satisfied with anything less than that each owner of tea should
with his own hands bring forth the same and burn it, and then
sign a declaration that he had acted in this affair voluntarily and
without any compulsion, and, moreover, pay the printer for inserting
it in the newspapers.</p>

<p>An act of Parliament for shutting up the port of Boston was
the immediate consequence of the destruction of the East-India
Company’s tea. It took place in June, 1774, and was considered
by the Americans as designed to reduce the Bostonians “to the
most servile and mean compliance ever attempted to be imposed
on a free people, and allowed to be infinitely more alarming
and dangerous to their common liberties than even the hydra,
the Stamp Act.”</p>

<p>Due care had been taken to enforce it, by sending General
Gage, as Governor, to Boston, where he arrived the preceding
month with a number of troops. Determined, however, as Parliament
seemed, on compulsion, the colonists were equally bent on
resistance, and resolved on a Continental Congress to direct their
operations. In the mean time, contributions for relieving the distressed
people in Boston were voted by the colonies; and Connecticut,
through the officiousness of Jonathan Trumbull, its Governor,
had the honour of first setting the example, by having a meeting
called in Hebron, the inhabitants of which remained loyal and
refused to vote for the collection. Governor Trumbull imputed
this to the influence of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters (of whom more
will be said hereafter) and his family. Many were the attempts
made to ruin his character, but unsuccessfully; he was too well
beloved and befriended in the town.</p>

<p>Falsehoods and seditions had now for some time been every day
increasing in the province; and men who were secret propagators
of traitorous opinions, pretended in public to look up to the Consociation,
the great focus of Divine illumination, for direction.
After much fasting and praying, that holy leaven discovered an
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>
admirable method of advancing the blessed work of protestant
liberty. The doors of prisons were opened, and prisoners became
leaders of mobs composed of negroes, vagabonds, and thieves,
who had much to gain and nothing to lose. The besom of destruction
first cleared away the creditors of the renegades, and
then the Sandemanians, presbyterians, and episcopalians. The
unfortunate complained to the Governor and magistrates of the
outrages of the banditti, begging the protection of the laws. The
following was the best answer returned by the magistrates:</p>

<p>“The proceedings of which you complain are like the acts of
Parliament; but be this as it may, we are only servants of the
people, in whom all power centres, and who have assumed their
natural right to judge and act for themselves.”</p>

<p>The loyalists armed, to defend themselves and property against
the public thieves; but the Liberty Boys were instantly honoured
by the ministers, deacons, and justices, who caused the Grand
Jury to indict, as tories and rioters, those who presumed to defend
their houses, and the courts fined and imprisoned them.</p>

<p>Thus horridly, by night and day, were the mobs driven on by
the hopes of plunder and the pleasure of domineering over their
superiors. Having sent terror and lamentation through their
own colony, the incarnate fiends paid a visit to the episcopalians
of Great Barrington, whose numbers exceeded that of the <span class="title">Sober
Dissenters</span>. Their wrath chiefly fell upon the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Bostwick
and David Ingersoll, Esq. The former was lashed with his back
to a tree, and almost killed; but on account of the fits of his wife
and mother, and the screamings of the women and children, the
mob released him upon his signing the eighteen articles, or their
League or Covenant, as they called it, (which without doubt was the
same as that drawn up and written by Governor Trumbull, which
will be referred to hereafter.) As to Mr. Ingersoll, after demolishing
his house and stealing his goods, they brought him
almost naked into Connecticut upon the bare back of a horse, in
spite of the distresses of his mother and sister, which were enough
to melt the heart of a savage, though producing in the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>
but peals of laughter that rent the skies.</p>

<p>Treatment so extremely barbarous did Mr. Ingersoll receive
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>
at their hands, that the sheriff of Litchfield County could not
withhold his interposition, by which means he was set at liberty,
after signing the league and covenant. The Grand Jury indicted
some of the leaders in this riot, but the Court dismissed them,
upon receiving information from Boston that Ingersoll had
seceded from the House of Representatives, and declared for the
King of England.</p>

<p>What caused this irruption of the mob into Great Barrington,
follows: The laws of Massachusets-Bay gave each town a power
to vote a tax for the support of the ministry, schools, poor, &amp;c.
The money, when collected, was deposited with the town treasurer,
who is obliged to pay it according to the determination of the
majority of the voters. The <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, for many years, had
been the majority in Barrington, and had annually voted about
two hundred pounds sterling for the ministry, above half of which
was taken from the Churchmen and Lutherans, whose ministers
could have no part of it, because separately the greatest number
of voters were <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, who gave the whole to their
minister. This was deemed liberty and gospel in New-England;
but mark the sequel. The Lutherans and some other sects having
joined the Church party, the Church gained the majority.
Next year the town voted the money, as usual, for the ministry,
&amp;c.; but the majority voted that the treasurer should pay the share
appointed for the ministry to the Church clergyman, which was
accordingly done; whereupon the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> cried out,
“Tyranny and persecution!” and applied to Governor Hutchinson,
then the idol and protector of the Independents, for relief. His
Excellency, ever willing to leave “Paul bound,” found a method of
reversing the vote of the majority of the freemen of Barrington
in favour of the Churchmen, calling it “a vote obtained by wrong
and fraud.” The Governor, by law or without law, appointed
Mayor Hawley, of Northampton, to be Moderator of the town-meeting
in Barrington. The Mayor accordingly attended, but,
after exerting himself for three days in behalf of his oppressed
brethren, was obliged to declare that the episcopalians had a great
majority of legal voters; he then went home, leaving matters as
he found them.</p>

<p><!--256.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>
The <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> were always so poor in Barrington
that they could not have supported their minister without taxing
their neighbours; and when they lost that power, their
minister departed from them, “because,” as he said, “the Lord
had called him to Rhode-Island.” To overthrow the majority
of the Church, and to establish the American Vine upon its old
foundation, was the main intention of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> of
Connecticut in visiting Great Barrington at this time.</p>

<p>The warlike preparations throughout the colonies, and the intelligence
obtained from certain credible refugees of a secret
design, formed in Connecticut and Massachusets-Bay, to attack
the royal army, induced General Gage to make some fortifications
upon Boston-Neck for their security. These, of course, gave
offence; but much more the excursion of a body of troops, on the
19th of April, 1775, to destroy a magazine of stores at Concord,
and the skirmishes which ensued. In a letter of the 28th of
April from Mr. Trumbull, the Governor of Connecticut, to General
Gage, after speaking of the “very just and general alarm”
given the “good people” of that province by his arrival at Boston
with troops, and subsequent fortifications, he tells the General
that “the late hostile and secret inroads of some of the
troops under his command into the heart of the country, and
the violence they had committed, had driven them almost into
a state of desperation.” Certain it is, that the populace were
then so maddened by false representations and aggravations of
events, unfortunate and lamentable enough in themselves, as to
be quite ripe for the rebellion the Governor and Assembly were
on the point of commencing, though they had the effrontery to
remonstrate against the defensive proceedings of the General,
in order to conceal their own treachery. Further on, in the same
letter, Mr. Trumbull writes thus: “The people of this colony,
you may rely upon it, abhor the idea of taking up arms against
the troops of their sovereign, and dread nothing so much as the
horrors of civil war; but, at the same time, we beg leave to assure
your Excellency that, as they apprehend themselves justified
by the principles of self-defence, so they are most firmly resolved
to defend their rights and privileges to the last extremity;
<!--257.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>
nor will they be restrained from giving aid to their brethren,
if an unjustifiable attack is made upon them. Is there no way
to prevent this unhappy dispute from coming to extremities?
Is there no alternative but absolute submission or the desolations
of war? By that humanity which constitutes so amiable
a part of your character, for the honour of our sovereign, and
by the glory of the British empire, we entreat you to prevent it,
if it be possible. Surely, it is to be hoped that the temperate
wisdom of the empire might, even yet, find expedients to restore
peace, that so all parts of the empire may enjoy their particular
rights, honours, and immunities. Certainly this is an event
most devoutly to be wished for; and will it not be consistent
with your duty to suspend the operations of war, on your part,
and enable us, on ours, to quiet the minds of the people, at
least till the result of some further deliberations may be
known?” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>From this letter, written, as it was, from the Governor of
a province at the desire of its General Assembly, the people of
England might have learned to think of the American as they did
of the French sincerity. It is almost past credit that, amidst the
earnest protestations it contains of a peaceable disposition in Mr.
Trumbull and the rest of his coadjutors in the Government of
Connecticut, they were meditating and actually taking measures
for the capture of certain of the King’s forts, and the destruction
of General Gage and his whole army, instead of quieting the minds
of the people! Yet such was the fact. They had commissioned
Motte and Phelps to draft men from the militia, if volunteers should
not readily appear, for a secret expedition, which proved to be
against Ticonderoga and Crown Point; and the treasurer of the
colony, by order of the Governor and Council, had paid 1500<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to
bear their expenses. Nay, even before the date of the above
amiable epistle, Motte and Phelps had left Hertford on that treasonable
undertaking, in which they were joined on the way by
Colonels Allen and Easton. Nor was this the only insidious enterprise
that they had to cover. The “good people” throughout
the province, to the number of nearly 20,000, were secretly arming
themselves, and filing off, to avoid suspicion, in small parties of
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>
ten and a dozen, to meet “their brethren” the Massachusets;
not, however, with the view of “giving aid, should any unjustifiable
able attack be made upon them,” but to “surprise” Boston by
storm. In addition to the Governor’s letter, the mock-peacemakers,
the General Assembly, had deputed Dr. Samuel Johnson, son
of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Johnson, spoken of in this work, and Oliver Wolcott,
Esq. both of the Council, which had ordered the 1500<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> for
the adventurers to Ticonderoga, to wait upon General Gage, the
more effectually to amuse and deceive him into confidence and inaction.
But happily, at a critical time, just before the intended
storm and slaughter at Boston, the news of the success of the
secret expedition reached the town, which fully discovered the
true character and business of the two Connecticut ambassadors,
and rendered it necessary for them, <span class="french" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span>, to retire from
Boston, and General Gage immediately to render the fortifications
at the Neck impregnable.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>, chagrined at being disappointed in their
hostile project against Boston, readily embraced the opportunities
which afforded of wreaking their vengeance upon New-York.
At the instance of the rebel party there, who found themselves
too weak to effect their purpose of subverting the Constitution of
the province, a large body immediately posted to their assistance,
delivered “their brethren” from the slavery of regal government,
and invested them with the liberty of doing that which was fit in
their own eyes, under the democratic administration of the immaculate
Livingstons, Morris, Schuyler, &amp;c. As seemed necessary
to the furtherance of their pacific views, frequent irruptions
were made afterwards, in which many loyalists were disarmed and
plundered, and some of them taken prisoners. Among these last
were the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Seabury and the Mayor of New-York. Governor
Tryon happily escaped their fury; as also did the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Miles Cooper, LL.D., who was leaving his house through a back
window when a party of ruffians burst into his chamber and
thrust their bayonets into the bed he had just quitted. Mr. Rivington
was one of the sufferers by the loss of his property.</p>

<p>These “good people” of Governor Trumbull’s, who dreaded
nothing so much as a civil war, with the reverse of reluctance,
<!--259.png--><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>
plundered his house of all printing materials and furniture, and
carried the type to Newhaven, where they were used in the service
of Congress.</p>

<p>The King’s statue, however, maintained its ground till after
General Washington, with the Continental army, had taken possession
of the city; when it was indicted for high treason against
the Dominions of America, found guilty, and received a quaint
sentence of this kind, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> That it should undergo the act of decollation;
and, inasmuch as it had no bowels, its legs should be
broken, and that the lead of it should be run into bullets, for
the destruction of the English bloody-backs, and the refuse cast
into the sea. The sentence was immediately carried into execution,
amidst the huzzas and vociferations of “Praise ye the
Lord!”</p>

<p>This insult upon his Majesty, General Washington, to his credit,
thought proper thus to notice in his general orders of the next
day. He was sorry, he said, that his soldiers should in a riotous
manner pull down the statue of the King of Great Britain.</p>

<p>While General Washington remained in possession of New-York,
Connecticut served as a prison for those persons who had
the misfortune to fall under his suspicion as disaffected to the
cause of freedom. He was himself, however, at length obliged to
evacuate it by General Howe, to the great relief of such royalists
as remained.</p>

<p>In April, 1777, some magazines having been formed by the
Americans at Danbury and Ridgfield, Major-General Tryon was
sent with 1800 men to carry off or destroy them.</p>

<p>They reached the places of their destination with little opposition;
but the whole force of the country being collected to obstruct
their return, the General was obliged to set the stores on
fire, by which means those towns were unavoidably burnt. David
Wooster, the rebel general, Benedict Arnold’s old friend and
acquaintance, and mobbing confederate, received a fatal ball
through his bladder as he was harassing the rear of the royal
troops, of which, after being carried forty miles to Newhaven, he
died, and was buried by the side of the grave of David Dixwell,
one of the Judges of Charles the First.</p>

<p><!--260.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>
In the summer of 1779 Sir Henry Clinton sent General Tryon,
with a large party of soldiers, for the relief of the loyalists in
Connecticut. They landed at Newhaven after much opposition,
and, having accomplished their object, sailed to Fairfield, which
town they were necessitated, by the opposition of the rebels, to set
fire to, before the loyalists could be released from prison. General
Tryon then repaired to Norwalk, where, having by proclamation
enjoined the inhabitants to keep within their houses, he ordered
sentinels to be stationed at every door to prevent disorders—a
tenderness, however, they insulted, by firing upon the very men
thus appointed to guard them. The consequence was, destruction
to themselves, and the whole town, which was laid in ashes.</p>

<p>I have now mentioned the principal proceedings by which the
people of Connecticut had distinguished themselves in bringing
on and supporting the rebellion in America, and that, I believe,
in a manner sufficiently particular to show their violence and
deceit.</p>

<p>It is very observable that a peculiar characteristic resolution
appeared to possess the people of Connecticut. As, on the one hand,
rebellion had erected her crest in that province with more insolence
and vigour than in the rest, so, on the other hand, loyalty
had there exhibited proofs of zeal, attachment, perseverance, and
fortitude, far beyond example elsewhere to be found in America.
In particular, the episcopal clergy had acquired immortal honour
by their steady adherence to their oaths and firmness under the
“assaults of their enemies;” not a man among them all, in this
fiery trial, having dishonoured either the King or Church of England
by apostacy. The sufferings of some of them I cannot pass
over in silence.</p>

<p>Among the greatest enemies to the cause of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>,
and among the greatest friends to that of the Church of England,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters stood conspicuous. A descendant of
one of the first settlers in the colony, greatly venerated and beloved
by the inhabitants of Hebron, where he was born in 1735,
and being a man of such truth and integrity as to command great
weight in all that concerned the benefits of the colony, it may
not be out of place to give a slight sketch of the treatment he received
<!--261.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>
at the commencement of the war, and the cause that drove
him from his native country.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the year 1758 Dr. Peters went to England for the purpose
of being ordained. He had been in ill health for some time previous
to this, but was most anxious for his ordination on account
of the church in Hebron being vacant. He remained in England,
very feeble, for some time, and refused a living there because he
wished to return to his numerous relations and friends in New-England,
and especially to Hebron, where he had left his
mother, whom he highly loved and venerated for her maternal
tenderness, wisdom, and piety, and for the sake of the episcopal
church in that town, erected in 1785, which never had a resident
clergyman, though they had sent four candidates to London
for holy orders, and all perished in going or returning, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> B. Dean, in returning, the ship and crew were lost in a
storm; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Jonathan Cotton, returning, died at sea with the
smallpox; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> —&#8203;— Feveryear, died on returning in the
West-Indies; Mr. James Usher, A. M., in going out, was taken
by the French and carried into Bayonne, dying there with the
smallpox.</p>

<p>These four deaths manifested the want of a bishop in North-America,
which was owing to bad policy, and not religion, and
was one great reason of the separation of the two countries, as
clearly now appears by bishops being now established in many
States without any offence to other protestant sects of christians.</p>

<p>His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord-Bishop
of London willingly gratified the wish of Dr. Peters, appointing
him Rector of Hebron and Hertford. The Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel in Foreign Parts appointed him their
itinerant missionary in New-England, and his Majesty George the
Second granted him his letters-patent of protection to all governors,
admirals, generals, and officers by sea and land, to protect
him against all insults and abuse, and to support him at all
times in his sacred office.</p>

Dr. Peters returned to Hebron in 1760, and was received with
much joy and gratitude by the people of all denominations, with
whom he had lived fourteen years in love, peace, and harmony,
without knowing an enemy, until the tea belonging to the East-India
Company was destroyed in Boston. The news, reaching
Hertford, caused great surprise and sorrow, and the people condemned
the illegal and violent action of the mob in Boston.</p>

<p>The news soon reached England, and the Government sent
General Gage and Admiral Graves to block up the harbour of Boston
and demand payment for the teas destroyed. Soon after their
arrival at Boston a report was spread through the country that
General Gage had shut up the town of Boston, and the people
must perish with hunger; whereupon Jonathan Trumbull, Governor
of Connecticut, pretending to credit the report, sent his circular
letter to every clergyman in the colony, requiring it to be
read on the Sabbath-day to their respective congregations, and to
urge the selectmen to warn town-meetings to appoint a general
contribution for the support of the poor people in Boston, shut up
to starve by General Gage and Admiral Graves.</p>

<p>The Governor’s letter was obeyed. Hebron held the first meeting.
Deacon John Phelps was chosen Moderator, and explained
the business of the meeting, giving leave to all persons to speak
their minds on the subject. Capt. Ben. Buell was the first who
spoke in favour of passing a vote for a general collection. Col.
Alex. Phelps next spoke against having any collection. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Elijah Lathrop made the third speech, in favour of a general collection.
The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Samuel Peters made the fourth speech,
against having any vote or collection, for the reasons following:</p>

<p>“First: Because Boston is not, and has not been, shut up by
order of General Gage, and all people pass out of and into Boston
as usual, and the citizens want not our charitable help; of consequence,
Governor Trumbull’s letter was premature, occasioned,
perhaps, by false information from some friend to the destroyers
of the teas, or an enemy to America.</p>

<p>“Secondly: Governor Trumbull, in his letter, has not assigned
any proof of the fact that Boston is, or has been, shut up by
General Gage.</p>

<p><!--263.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
“Thirdly: The teas destroyed in the harbour of Boston ought
to be paid for by the author of that horrible crime; for which
deed the King and Parliament have ordered Admiral Graves to
blockade the harbour of Boston, until the teas wickedly destroyed
are paid for; when the blockade will cease, or I will
give my last shilling to help the poor of Boston.”</p>

<p>The question was then called for.</p>

<p>The Moderator commanded silence, and said: “Will not more
of this Assembly speak on the subject?”</p>

<p>The answer was a general cry of “No! no!”</p>

<p>The Moderator then put the question: “Will you vote for the
general collection for the support of the poor, said to be shut up
in Boston to perish with hunger, by the order of General Gage?
You that are for the affirmative, hold up your right hands.”</p>

<p>Only four hands were held up.</p>

<p>The Moderator said: “You that are for the negative, hold
up your right hands.”</p>

<p>Every hand but the four was held up.</p>

<p>The Moderator proclaimed that the negatives, by a vast majority,
had determined the question. “Therefore, I dissolve this
town-meeting.”</p>

<p>Hertford, the capital of Connecticut colony, held the next town-meeting,
and, after due consideration of Governor Trumbull’s
letter, unanimously negatived to vote for a general collection, and
the Moderator dissolved the town-meeting.</p>

<p>The doings of Hertford and Hebron were soon spread, and put
a stop to all other town-meetings in Connecticut, to the disappointment
and mortification of Governor Trumbull, who laid the
blame on the influence of Dr. Peters, the episcopal clergyman of
these two towns.</p>

<p>Hence the Governor spread the report that Dr. Peters was a
dangerous enemy to America, by his correspondence with Lord
North and the bishops of England, and ought to be driven out of
his native country for the safety of it. Governor Trumbull began
and effected this by his Windham mobs, and the mobs of the tea-destroyers
in Boston harbour.</p>

<p>This is the true cause of Dr. Peters leaving America, and not
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>
because he was an enemy; for he was never an enemy to any man
in his life.</p>

<p>This statement Governor Trumbull spread by his letters to
the ministers in Windham, where he resided, and added that it
could be proved by copies of letters in the Doctor’s house, if sought
for suddenly. This letter was read at the meeting on Sunday,
the 14th of August, 1774, which caused a large number of the
hearers to unite in the afternoon and ride to Hebron, and, after
midnight, to surround the house of Dr. Peters, awaking him
and his family in great surprise.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters opened the window, and desired to be informed
what was the occasion of such a multitude assembling? The answer
was, “To search your house! Open your doors!”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters said: “I know you not, but will open my doors
very soon.”</p>

<p>Having put on his clothes, he opened his doors and gate, when
ten men came into his house. Dr. Peters begged them to be
seated, and they sat down. They then said: “We have waited
upon you, sir, to search your house from top to bottom, to find
your correspondence with the English bishops, Lord North,
and other people in Great Britain.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters replied: “Your demand is new and extraordinary;
but here are my keys and library, and you can search my house,
but I hope you will not destroy my papers.”</p>

<p>They searched, and read all his correspondence with the bishops
and people in England and Europe, and on Monday, before
noon, reported to the multitude that they had “seen and read
the correspondence held by Dr. Peters with the people of England,
and found nothing against the liberty and rights of America;
and, as we have been misinformed, let us return home;”
and off they went.</p>

<p>This did not satisfy Governor Trumbull. He therefore sent
another mob from Windham, armed with guns, swords, and staves,
to visit Dr. Peters, and require his signature to eighteen articles
which he (the Governor) had written, and his son David,
one of the commanders of the mob, presented to Dr. Peters, who
read and returned it, saying: “Sir, I cannot sign it without
<!--265.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>
violating my conscience, the laws of my God, and my oath to
my King.”</p>

<p>David Trumbull replied: “My father told me you might sign
it with safety, and it would save you and your house.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters replied he would not sign it to save his life, and all
the world, from destruction.</p>

<p>David Trumbull said: “Then you must take the consequences.”</p>

<p>His mob then fired balls into the house, and with stones, bricks,
and clubs broke the doors, windows, and furniture, wounding his
mother, the nurse of his infant son, and his two brothers, and
seizing him, tore off his hat, wig, gown, and cassock, stripping
off his shirt, made him naked, (except his breeches, stockings, and
shoes,) struck him with their staves and spat in his face, and then
placed him upon a horse and carried him more than a mile to
their liberty-pole, where they threatened to tar and feather him,
and hang him up by the hands, unless he would sign the eighteen
articles.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters said: “I am in your power; you can soon finish
my mortal existence, but you cannot destroy my immortal
soul; and, to save it, I refuse to sign any one of those articles.”</p>

<p>The mob now cried: “Send for the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Pomeroy to
pray for this stubborn old tory, before we send him to his own
place.”</p>

<p>A sergeant and twelve men were ordered to call on Dr.
Pomeroy and desire him to attend and pray for this wicked old
tory Peters.</p>

<p>Dr. Pomeroy answered: “I will not attend, nor give any
countenance in murdering the best man in Hebron.”</p>

<p>The sergeant reported Dr. Pomeroy’s answer. Then an order
was given to the mob to go and bring Dr. Pomeroy to the liberty-pole,
to be dealt with according to his demerits. The mob went,
but could not find Dr. Pomeroy.</p>

<p>By this time the mob had drunk sufficiently, and the two
commanders (David Trumbull and Major Wright) stood near Dr.
Peters. The Hebron people had now collected, and were prepared
to take Dr. Peters out of the hands of the mob. Three
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>
bold troopers rode up to the commander, and said: “We have
come to kill you, or deliver Dr. Peters. Resign him, or die!”—placing
their pistols at the commanders’ breasts. They said:
“Take him away, and be silent.” They then instantly led him
away.</p>

<p>Major Wright mounted his horse, and cried to his mob,
“Silence! We have done enough to this old tory priest for
one day, and in four days we will return and subdue his obstinate
temper and finish this day’s work. Make ready and follow
me to Lebanon.”</p>

<p>The mob obeyed, and on their way they saw the wife of
John Manee, Esq. sister to Dr. Peters, at whom they discharged
three musket-balls, which missed her. The mob huzzaed, and
cried out, “We are dam’d sorry!”</p>

<p>The troopers carried Dr. Peters into the house of David Barber,
Esq. where they put on his clothes, and conducted him
home to his half-ruined house.</p>

<p>The next day Dr. Peters went in his carriage and called on
Governor Trumbull, and demanded his protection against the
Windham mobs.</p>

<p>The Governor replied: “I was once Governor of the people,
but they have taken all power out of my hands into their own;
and you must apply to them for protection, and it is in your
power to gain it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters asked his Honour to tell him by what means.</p>

<p>The Governor said: “By signing the paper they presented to
you yesterday, which you refused to sign, and so brought on
you their just resentment.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters replied: “Sir, do you think it my duty to sign
the eighteen articles your son David, at the head of a mob, demanded
me to sign?”</p>

<p>The Governor answered: “Yes, by all means.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters: “Do you wish to have me justify the outrageous
action of casting into the sea the teas, the property of English
merchants?”</p>

<p>The Governor replied: “Yes; and all friends of America will
do it.”</p>

<p><!--267.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>
Dr. Peters: “Did your Honour mean to have me guilty of perjury
and high treason, by signing those eighteen articles, which
you wrote and gave to your son David for me to sign?”</p>

<p>The Governor replied: “Why do you say I wrote those eighteen
articles?”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters answered: “Because I read them, and well know
your handwriting; and your son David, Major Wright, and Mr.
Croker, told me so, and that you had sent them to demand my
signature to the paper. I told them I dare not and could not
sign them without committing perjury and high treason, and
violating my own conscience and God’s laws.”</p>

<p>The Governor replied: “There is no treason in saying that
George the Third, King of England, is a ‘Roman Catholic,’ a
‘tyrant,’ and an ‘idiot,’ and has forfeited the crown; that no
true friend of America ought to obey him, or any of his laws.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters here arose and took leave of the Governor, with
the Hon. William Hillhouse and Capt. David Tarbox, who had
been present during the interview, and, when out of the house,
declared they were astonished at the words and conduct of the
Governor.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters then rode to the Judges of the Supreme Court sitting
at Hertford, Col. Eliphalet Dyer being one of the Judges,
and desired the Court to protect him from the mob at Windham,
who had ill-used him, and threatened to take his life in four days
if he did not sign his name to a paper containing eighteen treasonable
articles.</p>

<p>The Court replied: “We are ready to do our duty, when the
King’s Attorney shall exhibit an indictment against the rioters.”</p>

<p>The Attorney arose, and told the Court that it was the duty
of the Grand Jury to exhibit the indictment, and not his.</p>

<p>Thus ended the protection of the Supreme Court of Connecticut.</p>

<p>From thence Dr. Peters drove in his carriage to Newhaven,
forty miles west from Hertford, and so shunned a third visit
of the Windham mob. Here the Doctor applied to the Hon.
James Hillhouse for protection, who said: “My house is your
protection; yet I want protection myself against the mobs of
Colonel Wooster and Dr. Benedict Arnold, who are mobbing
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>
the Sandemanians for having spoken against the outrageous
conduct of the destroyers of the teas in Boston harbour. But
as you decline my offer, I advise you to put up at the house of
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Hubbard, and, if any disturb you, warn them to
keep out of the yard and house upon pain of death; and if they
break the gate, shoot them, and kill as many as enter the yard.
I will raise men, and come to your assistance.”</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Hubbard gave up his house to Dr. Peters, and,
on hearing that Arnold and Wooster had said they would visit
Peters and Hubbard as soon as they had finished with the Sandemanians,
Dr. Hubbard removed his wife and children to a neighbour’s
house, and Dr. Peters told him he would pay for all the
damage that might be done to his house. Dr. Peters fastened the
gate, and obtained twenty muskets, powder, and balls, and, loading
the muskets, with his servants and a friend waited for the mob’s
coming.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock in the evening Dr. Arnold and his mob came to
the gate, and found it shut and barred. He called out to open the
gate, and Dr. Peters answered: “The gate shall not be opened
this night but on pain of death!”—holding a musket in his hand.</p>

<p>The mob cried: “Dr. Arnold, break down the gate, and we
will follow you, and punish that tory Peters!”</p>

<p>Arnold replied: “Bring an axe, and split down the gate!”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters said: “Arnold, so sure as you split the gate, I will
blow your brains out, and all that enter this yard to-night!”</p>

<p>Arnold retired from the gate, and told one of his fellows to go
forward and split the gate. The mob then cried out: “Dr. Arnold
is a coward!”</p>

<p>Arnold replied: “I am no coward; but I know Dr. Peters’
disposition and temper, and he will fulfill every promise he
makes; and I have no wish for death at present.”</p>

<p>The mob then cried: “Let us depart from this tory house!”</p>

<p>In half an hour after appeared another mob, under the command
of Col. David Wooster, and ordered the gate to be opened.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters told Wooster not to open that gate unless he was
ready to die, and whoever came this night into the yard, or house,
he would shoot, at the same time showing his musket.</p>

<p><!--269.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>
Wooster then said to his mob: “Let us go on, and leave this
episcopal tory, who has madness enough to kill any man, and
we will see him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The mobs raised a liberty-pole, and kept watch all night over
Dr. Peters; but some friends took his horses over the water to
Branford, where Dr. Peters and his servant went the next day in
disguise, and from there to Saybrook, and thence to Hebron,
where they arrived at midnight on Saturday, and found ten men
watching his return; who soon informed the Windham mobs, who
prepared on Sunday to pay a visit to Dr. Peters on Sunday night.</p>

<p>The Doctor preached in the church to a numerous congregation
in the morning. At 11 o’clock a friend arrived from Windham
and informed the Doctor that a large mob would be at his
house by midnight, and advised him to abscond, and not attend
church in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters desired him to be silent, and attended church in the
afternoon, when the assembly was much increased, and the Doctor
preached an affectionate sermon from these words: “O that my
head was water, and my eyes fountains of tears. I would weep
day and night for the transgressions of my people.” The discourse
drew tears from every eye, and the congregation was dismissed,
after a most excellent prayer. Many people attended the
Doctor to his house, and quietness remained till darkness came on,
when several persons were observed around the house as spies.</p>

<p>The Doctor then ordered a servant to take a valuable horse
and ride to the west two miles, and then turn and ride to the east
until he reached Carter’s tree, and there abide until the Doctor
came to him.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters then told his mother, to prevent a civil war between
the Windham mob coming and the people of Hebron, he must
leave her, and go to Boston for protection. He then walked out
into his garden in the dark, and thence, unsuspected, across the
fields to his servant and horse. Mounting, he told his servant to
go home, and tell no person where he saw him last. He then rode
off for Boston, 100 miles, and reached there at 5 <span class="sc">P. M.</span> the next
day, and had an interview with General Gage and Admiral
Graves, who gave him ample protection.</p>

<p><!--270.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>
The Windham mob went to the east border of Hebron, and
three spies met them, and told them Dr. Peters had gone off to the
west—likely to New-York. The mob therefore returned home.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters remained in Boston some weeks, and hearing that
the ship Fox was soon to sail for England, he went off in the
night and walked ten miles, when the stage-coach overtook him
and carried him to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Sir John Wentworth, Governor of Newhampshire, and the
Hon. Col. Atkinson, called upon him and invited him to dine,
and begged him to preach on Sunday, as their church was
vacant by the death of Dr. Browne. Dr. Peters replied: “I
would readily comply with your request, but for fear of letting
the tea-destroyers of Boston know where I am; and you know
their malice against me by the newspapers.”</p>

<p>Sir John replied: “They have no influence in Portsmouth, and
we can and will protect you against those public enemies.”</p>

<p>Dr. Peters consented, and preached in their church on the following
Sunday.</p>

<p>All was quiet till Wednesday, at noon, when a man rode up to
the door and called the hostler to take his horse and feed him.
He then came in and called for dinner. He saw Dr. Peters, but
did not know him, and asked him if he belonged to the house.</p>

<p>The Doctor said “Yes.” He then gave him a Boston newspaper,
in which was an advertisement, signed John Hancock,
promising 200<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to any person taking up the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Peters
and delivering him to a Committee of Safety, he having “retreated
from Boston in the night, and will do mischief wherever
he goes, being a most bitter enemy to the rights and liberty of
America.”</p>

<p>The man asked the Doctor: “Have you seen that wicked
old priest?”</p>

<p>The Doctor replied: “The landlord was at church, and a
stranger preached last Sunday; perhaps he can tell his name.
I will go and call him.”</p>

<p>The Doctor went and told the landlord what the stranger was
in pursuit of, and wished to see him.</p>

<p>The landlord told his servant to run and tell the ferryman
<!--271.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>
to say to any one inquiring after a clergyman, that he had carried
over a man in black clothes last Monday, who looked like a
clergyman, and who said he was going to Casco Bay, and from
thence to London in a mast-ship. The servant soon did his
errand, and the landlord went with the Doctor to the stranger at
dinner, who wished to know if he could inform him whether
Priest Peters had been in Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The landlord replied: “Yes; he preached in our church last
Sunday, and it was said he was going to Casco Bay, to take
passage to London in a mast-ship.”</p>

<p>The stranger said: “I am in pursuit of him, and four other
men coming from Boston will be here soon, and we will have
him in custody. I will follow him to Casco Bay, or hell, to take
him. Tell my friends so when they arrive.”</p>

<p>He then mounted his horse and rode to the ferry. Asking
the ferryman if he had carried over Priest Peters, he answered:
“I cannot tell. I carried over a man in black clothes last Monday,
who was going to Casco Bay.”</p>

<p>The stranger said: “Mr. Ferryman, shoot me over quick, and
I will give you five shillings.” The ferryman soon got his five
shillings, and the stranger rode off with speed seventy miles, and
returned without his prize.</p>

<p>His four companions arrived in the evening, and caused the
bells to be rung and the mobs to assemble, who searched the
Governor’s house and the town to find Dr. Peters, and gain
Hancock’s reward of 200<span class="abbrev"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, but found not the Doctor, who was
well secured in a cave on the seashore, where he remained fourteen
days.</p>

<p>The Casco Bay news enraged the mob, and they again searched
the Governor’s house, the town, and Captain Norman’s ship, the
Fox, placing a guard on board to prevent him taking passengers
or sailing for London. They searched the fort three times
for the Doctor, but found him not, and placed sentinels in every
part of the town, by day and night, to discover him.</p>

<p>The news of the situation of Dr. Peters reached Boston. General
Gage and Admiral Graves sent an armed ship of sixteen guns
to take him from the cave and carry him to Boston, or any other
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>
place he might select. The ship arrived in the night, and took the
Doctor on board.</p>

<p>The captain asked him if he should carry him to Boston, or
Halifax?</p>

<p>The Doctor said he preferred London, in the ship Fox, Commander
Norman, lying in the river Piscataqua, but that the mob
would not permit him, or the ship, to sail.</p>

<p>The captain replied: “I will see to that!” and sailed into the
river, hailed the ship Fox, and asked if she was ready to sail.
The answer was, “Yes.” The captain then said: “Let down a
chair.” It was done, and he and his men went on board the
ship Fox, and called for the master. He appeared, and the captain
asked: “What men are those on your decks?”</p>

<p>The master replied: “The committee of safety sent on board
by the mob of the town of Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>The captain said: “I commit to your care this worthy and
venerable clergyman, Dr. Samuel Peters; conduct him to your
cabin, and carry him safe to England;” and then, turning
to the Committee of Safety, he ordered them to quit the ship
in five minutes, or he would throw them overboard into the
river. “Your company is not wanted here. I will guard the
ship.”</p>

<p>The committee of safety instantly fled into their boats, and
went on shore.</p>

<p>The captain ordered the master to hoist his anchors and sails
and go to sea. The master obeyed the order, and, October 27,
1774, sailed down the river, the captain following with his ship.
The mob on shore, behind some rocks, fired three cannon at the
war-ship, who returned their shots, which silenced the mob, and
they ran away.</p>

<p>The captain guarded the ship Fox out to sea, clear of the
land, and then took leave of her and returned to Boston.</p>

<p>Captain Norman arrived in Portsmouth, December 21, 1774,
and carefully executed his orders—put Dr. Peters on shore, who
next day reached London, where he was graciously received by
the Lord-Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Cornwallis, and the
Lord-Bishop of London, Dr. Terrick, and the Ministry. He had
<!--273.png--><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>
also the honour of kissing the hand of his Majesty, King George
the Third.</p>

<p>General Gage and Admiral Graves, two years after, sent, in
the Somerset man-of-war, the only daughter of Dr. Peters to
England, who was at boarding-school at Boston, (she having seen
the battle of Bunker’s Hill,) to save her from future evils, and comfort
her father in his retreat from the tyranny of the mobs in
his native country.</p>

<p>Thus suffered the venerable and exemplary Dr. Samuel Peters,
only for obeying his conscience, his God, his king, and the laws
of his native country, by censuring the rioters and destroyers of
the teas, the property of the East-India Company.</p>

<p>He was highly respected, in England as well as in America, by
all pious, benevolent, scientific, and moral christians of all denominations;
and he never knew he had an enemy, (until Gov. Jonathan
Trumbull, of Connecticut, vouchsafed to support the atrocities
of the mobs,) as appears by his benevolent conduct in England
to his enemies of New-England, who had ill-treated him two
years before the rebellion was commenced.</p>

<p>After the war began many of the Windham mob, who spat in
the Doctor’s face and grossly insulted him otherwise, were brought
prisoners into England, and were in great distress. They then
applied to the Doctor for help, (knowing his character in America,)
and they never applied in vain; he always helped them, and
in many instances obtained their release. They returned home
and reported that Dr. Peters was like Joseph in Egypt, and had
delivered them out of all their troubles. “Dr. Peters,” they said,
“fed us when we were hungry, clothed us when naked, visited us
in prison, and delivered us out of our distress. He never
reproached us for what we had done to him and his family.
When we confessed to having abused him, he replied, ‘God
hath sent me here before you to save your lives; it was not
you that sent me here. Haste ye; go home, and sin no
more.’”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such reports were spread through New-England
by the redeemed captives, the destroyers of the teas, and
their mobs, continued their malicious and false sayings in the
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span>
newspapers against the Doctor, of whom no man in New or
Old-England ever knew one crime of his from his birth; but,
on the contrary, was known for his actions of charity, goodwill,
and kindness, to all of the human family.</p>

<p>In June, 1806, the Doctor paid a visit to Hebron, his native
town, and was received with acclamations of great joy by the inhabitants,
the children of his contemporaries, who were all dead
in thirty-one years during his absence (except ten persons). He
remained in Hebron six weeks, and then paid a visit to Hertford,
the capital of Connecticut State, once his faithful parish, and now
the seat of bishops. He was kindly and joyfully received by the
inhabitants, with whom he spent some time with great pleasure,
and from thence returned to New-York, which he made his home.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Messrs. Mansfield and Veits were cast into gaol, and
afterwards tried for high treason against America. Their real offence
was charitably giving victuals and blankets to loyalists flying
from the rage of drunken mobs. They were fined and imprisoned,
to the ruin of themselves and families. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Messrs. Graves,
Scovil, Debble, Nichols, Leaming, Beach, and divers others, were
cruelly dragged through mire and dirt. In short, all the clergy
of the Church were infamously insulted, abused, and obliged to
seek refuge in the mountains, till the popular frenzy was somewhat
abated.</p>

<p>In July, 1776, the Congress, having declared the independence
of America, ordered the Commonwealth to be prayed for, instead
of the King and royal family. All the loyal episcopal churches
north of the Delaware were shut up, except those under the protection
of the British army, and one in Newtown, in Connecticut,
of which last the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. John Beach was the rector, whose
gray hairs, adorned with loyal and christian virtues, overcame even
the madness of the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span>.</p>

<p>This faithful disciple disregarded the congressional mandate,
and, praying for the King as usual, they pulled him out of his
desk, put a rope about his neck, and drew him across the Osootonoc
River at the tail of a boat, to cool his loyal zeal, as they
called it; after which the old confessor was permitted to depart,
though not without prohibition to pray longer for the King. But
<!--275.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>
his loyal zeal was insuperable. He went to church and prayed
again for the King, upon which the <span class="title">Sober Dissenters</span> again seized
him, and resolved upon cutting out his tongue; when the heroic
veteran said: “If my blood must be shed, let it not be done in
the house of God.” The pious mob then dragged him out of
the church, laid his neck upon a block, and swore they would cut
off his head, and insolently cried out: “Now, you old devil,
say your last prayer!” He prayed thus: “God bless King
George, and forgive all his and my enemies.” At this unexpected
and exalted display of christian patience and charity the
mob so far relented as to discharge him, and never molest him
afterwards for adhering to the liturgy of the Church of England
and his ordination-oath; but they relaxed not their severities
towards the other clergymen, because, they said, younger consciences
are more flexible.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this work without remarking what a contrast
to the episcopal clergy of Connecticut, and especially the
illustrious examples of the venerable Beach and Peters, was offered
to many of those that were in the provinces south of the Delaware!
In Connecticut, where they suffered everything but death
for tenaciously adhering to their ordination-oaths, there some of
them, with more enlarged consciences, were not ashamed to commit
perjury in prayer and rebellion in preaching. Though, be it
remembered, these expressions were decent when compared with
those of the fanatics in New-England.</p>

<p>The following prayer, used by them before Congress after the
declaration of independence, is likely to gratify the curiosity of
my readers. It brought the clergymen into disgrace merely by its
moderation:</p>

<p>“O Lord, our heavenly Father, King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, who dost from Thy throne behold all the dwellers of the
earth, and reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over
all kingdoms, empires, and governments: look down in mercy,
we beseech Thee, upon these our American States, who have
fled to Thee from the rod of the oppressor, and thrown themselves
upon Thy gracious protection, desiring henceforth to be
dependent only on Thee. To Thee have they appealed for the
<!--276.png--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>
righteousness of their cause; to Thee do they look up for that
countenance and support which Thou alone canst give. Take
them, therefore, heavenly Father, under Thy nurturing care;
give them wisdom in council and valour in the field. Defeat the
malicious designs of our cruel adversaries; convince them of the
unrighteousness of their cause, and, if they still persist in their
sanguinary purposes, O let the voice of Thy unerring justice,
sounding in their hearts, constrain them to drop the weapons of
war from their enervated hands in the day of battle. Be Thou
present, O God of wisdom, and direct the councils of this honourable
Assembly. Enable them to settle things upon the best
and surest foundation; that the scenes of blood may soon be
closed; that order, harmony, and peace may effectually be restored,
and truth and justice, religion and piety, prevail and
flourish amongst Thy people. Preserve the health of their
bodies and the vigor of their minds; shower down upon them,
and the millions they represent, such temporal blessings as
Thou seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them
with everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask
in the name, and through the merits, of Jesus Christ Thy Son,
our Saviour. Amen.”</p>

<hr class="medium" />
<h4 class="h4head">THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION,</h4>

<p class="hanging">AND OTHER POLITICAL ESSAYS. By <span class="sc">Walter Bagehot</span>,
author of “Physics and Politics.” Latest revised edition. 1 <abbr title="volume, duodecimo">vol., 12mo.</abbr>
Cloth. Price, $2.00.</p>

<p class="small">“With the author’s inclination and capacity to regard public questions in their scientific
aspects, many readers are already familiar through his suggestive volume entitled
‘Physics and Politics.’ ‘The English Constitution’ is a work of the same quality, and
treats its subjects very much with reference to the principles of human nature and the
natural laws of human society. It is a free disquisition on English political experience;
an acute, critical, and dispassionate discussion of English institutions designed to show
how they operate, and to point out their defects and advantages. The writer is not so
much a partisan or an advocate, as a cool, philosophical inquirer, with large knowledge,
clear insight, independent opinions, and great freedom from the bias of what he terms
that ‘territorial sectarianism called patriotism.’ His criticism of the faults of the English
system is searching and trenchant, and his appreciation of its benefits and usefulness
is cordial, discriminating, and wise. The book, indeed, is full of instructive episodes,
and sagacious reflections on the springs of action in human nature, the exercise of power
by individuals or political bodies, the adaptation of institutions to the qualities and circumstances
of the different classes who live under them, and numerous points of political
philosophy, which are applicable everywhere and have an interest for all students of
political and social affairs.”—<cite>Extract from preface.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 center">THE VARIOUS CONTRIVANCES<br />

<span class="smaller">BY WHICH</span></p>

<h4 class="h4head">ORCHIDS ARE FERTILIZED BY INSECTS.</h4>

<p class="hanging">By <span class="sc">Charles Darwin</span>, M. A. Second edition, revised. With Illustrations.
1 <abbr title="volume, duodecimo">vol., 12mo.</abbr> Cloth. Price, $1.75.</p>

<p class="small">“Mr. Darwin has prepared a new edition of his work on the fertilization of orchids
by insects, which was published in 1862, and has been for some time out of print. He
has, during the interval, received a great deal of information on the subject from various
correspondents, and has also continued his own researches; and he has used the
materials thus obtained in remodeling the original work. The object which the writer has
in view is, as he explains, not only to show how wonderfully complex and perfect are the
contrivances by which orchids are fertilized with pollen brought by insects from a distinct
plant, but also to support his theory that ‘it is an almost universal law of Nature
that the higher organic beings require an occasional cross with another individual; or,
which is the same thing, that no hermaphrodite fertilizes itself for a perpetuity of generations.’”—<cite>Saturday
Review.</cite></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 class="h4head">BLACK SPIRITS AND WHITE.</h4>

<p class="hanging">By <span class="sc">Frances Eleanor Trollope</span>, author of “a Charming Fellow,”
etc. 1 <abbr title="volume, octavo">vol., 8vo.</abbr> Illustrated. Paper covers. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<p class="small">“It has all the rapid movement of a play, and is at the same time full of piquant
character-study. The personages of the story have life and thorough individuality—there
is not a puppet among them. It has been said of one of them—the American
‘medium’—that he is simply a caricature; but those who have seen a certain erratic
countryman of ours will recognize many of his curious traits.”—<cite><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Tribune.</cite></p>

<hr class="short" />

<!--288.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>

<h4 class="h4head">GARTH.</h4>

<p class="hanging">A Novel. By <span class="sc">Julian Hawthorne</span>, author of “Bressant,” “Saxon Studies,” etc. 1
<abbr title="volume, octavo">vol., 8vo.</abbr> Paper covers, $1.00; cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="small">“‘Garth,’ is Mr. Julian Hawthorne’s most elaborate and pretentious book. It is on
many accounts also his best book, though it contains nothing so good as the character
of the hero in ‘Bressant.’ At least his genius is unmistakable. And we are disposed
to venture the suggestion that, if ‘Garth’ had not been a serial, it would have been more
compact and closely written, and so its situations more effective, its characters better
sustained.”—<cite>New York World.</cite></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 class="h4head">THE ART OF ELECTRO-METALLURGY.</h4>

<p class="hanging">Including all Known Processes of Electro-Deposition. By <span class="sc">G. Gore</span>, LL. D., F. R. S.
1 <abbr title="volume, duodecimo">vol., 12mo.</abbr> 391 pages. Illustrated. $2.50.</p>

<p class="small">“I have endeavored not only to make the book a treatise on the practical art of
Electro-Metallurgy, but also to include an outline of the science of electro-chemistry,
upon which that art is based; and I have also spared no trouble in order to make it
as perfect as I could; the most complete portions are those which treat of the common
methods of silvering, gilding, moulding; the deposition of copper, nickel, brass, iron,
and tin; the special details of the art; and the accounts of such experiments and processes
with the less common metals, as scientific investigators and practical inventors
may be likely to further examine or practically apply.”—<cite>Extract from Preface.</cite></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 class="h4head">THE ELEMENTS OF MACHINE-DESIGN.</h4>

<p class="hanging">An Introduction to the Principles which determine the Arrangement and Proportions
of the Parts of Machines, and a Collection of Rules for Machine-Design. By
<span class="sc">W. Cawthorne Unwin</span>. 1 <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>, 12mo. Illustrated. $1.50.</p>

<p class="small">“No labor has been spared in condensing into the smallest compass the information
at the author’s disposal, and in endeavoring to render the treatment of the subject
simple and clear. If the student’s path has in any degree been rendered easy, it is because
a good deal of labor has been expended on the roadway.”—<cite>Extract from Preface.</cite></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 class="h4head">AFTER MANY DAYS.</h4>

<p class="hanging">A Novel. By <span class="sc">Christian Reid</span>, author of “Morton House,” “Valerie Aylmer,” etc.
1 <abbr title="volume, octavo">vol., 8vo.</abbr> Paper covers, $1.00; cloth $1.50.</p>

<p class="small">“After Many Days” is marked by those characteristics that have made the name
of Christian Reid distinguished—flowing style, charm and contrast of character, dramatic
situations and effective development of plot. The scene is laid partly in the
South and partly in England, while its narrative exhibits notable variety of incident
and strength of interest.</p>

Frontispiece and Route Maps and Preface comparing Results of the English and
Austrian Expeditions. One <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>, medium <abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr>, cloth, extra, $3.50.</p>

<p class="small">“We advise all who desire to enjoy a genuine and unalloyed pleasure to read his

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
